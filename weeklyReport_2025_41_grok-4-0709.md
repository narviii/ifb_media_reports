# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

- This week, from October 6-12, 2025, creators highlighted a surge in indie eyeshadow palette releases, emphasizing unique color stories and high pigmentation that drove positive commentary across multiple channels.

## 1. Overview

The week reflected strong enthusiasm for indie makeup launches, with creators focusing on palettes that blend seasonal fall tones with unconventional themes like decay and gothic romance. Videos often showcased detailed swatches and tutorials, underscoring the reliability of indie formulas in delivering pigmentation and blendability without fallout.

Some fatigue emerged around mainstream repackaged products, such as holiday sets from Natasha Denona, where creators noted shade duplication and questioned value for existing collectors. In contrast, indie brands like Simply Posh and Bella Beauté Bar received consistent praise for fresh, artistic approaches that avoided redundancy.

Influencer skepticism appeared in discussions of high-price items like Danessa Myricks' Lightwork VII, balanced by excitement for accessible indies. Overall, the landscape leaned toward value-driven comparisons, with affiliate codes frequently used to signal endorsement and drive purchases.

Complexion frustration was minimal, but lip and cheek products saw repeat mentions for comfortable, long-wearing formulas. The tone across content was analytical, with creators prioritizing performance over hype.

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

Top mentioned indie products included Simply Posh Black Cherry Palette (positive sentiment for cohesive cherry-toned mattes and multidimensional shimmers, noted in four creators for high pigmentation and minimal fallout); Bella Beauté Bar Dark Dreamscape Palette and Highlighter (positive for intense purple-blue shifts and ethereal finishes, praised across five videos for versatility in eyes and cheeks); Nomad Cosmetics Pacific Northwest Palette (positive for moody green-burgundy tones and beginner-friendly pigmentation, highlighted in three creators); Blend Bunny x Mei Pang Rotten Palette (positive for all-matte 'ugly cool' decay-inspired shades, seen in four videos for excellent blendability and depth); and Unearthly Cosmetics Gothic Romance Palette (positive for gradient pinks-oranges-purples and emollient shimmers, mentioned in two creators).

Sentiment trends were predominantly positive, with mixed notes on emollient shimmers prone to creasing (e.g., in Bella Beauté Bar and Unearthly). Context centered on performance, with strong emphasis on longevity and texture—mattes blended seamlessly, shimmers offered high-impact shifts, and prices were viewed as strong value (e.g., $45 for Singe Beauty Paisley Hoot).

Clusters showed lots of creators testing Simply Posh and Blend Bunny releases, positioning them as default points for fall comparisons; repeat criticism around overly monochromatic palettes without shimmers, but countered by praise for added novelty in indies like Nomad.

## 3. Category Trends

Eyeshadow palettes dominated momentum, with repeated focus on multichrome shimmers and all-matte formulas for dramatic, layered looks. Lip products, including liners and hybrid balms, gained traction for comfortable, pigmented options like Bella Beauté Bar Lip Sparkle Balms and Melt Cosmetics pencils.

Creators gravitated toward moody, unconventional aesthetics like mold-inspired decay (Blend Bunny) and gothic romance (Unearthly, Gourmande Girls), favoring textures with high shine and duochrome shifts over basic mattes.

Some fatigue appeared around repetitive neutral palettes (e.g., Patrick Ta matte edits seen as unnecessary duplicates), with skepticism on high-price mainstream items lacking innovation.

Seasonal shifts signaled rising demand for fall tones—deep berries, earthy greens, and warm neutrals—transitioning from summer brights to darker, more dimensional options.

## 4. Emerging Themes & Narratives

- Indie brand dominance: Multiple creators (Angelica Nyqvist, battybean, Heather Austin, Rachel Palmieri) aligned on the superior quality and creativity of Western indie releases like Simply Posh and Blend Bunny, noting increased visibility and positive adoption compared to mainstream, with momentum building for brands originating in the US/Canada.
- Unconventional color stories: Cross-creator emphasis (Angelica, battybean, Rachel) on experimental themes like mold/decay (Blend Bunny Rotten) and gothic/dark fantasy (Bella Beauté Bar Dark Dreamscape, Gourmande Girls Nevermore), gaining traction for artistic appeal without regional ties.
- Multichrome and shifty finishes: At least three creators (Heather Austin, battybean, Angelica) highlighted demand for complex, light-shifting shimmers in palettes (Danessa Myricks Lightwork VII, Nomad Pacific Northwest), with positive sentiment for performance but mixed on creasing, indicating steady indie momentum over J/K/C-beauty origins.
- Restock and FOMO culture: Alignment in Angelica and battybean on urgency from limited restocks (Oden’s Eye Hela) and new collabs, driving sentiment through scarcity without fatigue.

## 5. Purchase-Intent Signals

Repeated "I'd buy this" sentiment emerged around indie palettes with unique stories, like Blend Bunny Rotten for its chaotic mattes and Nomad Pacific Northwest for earthy tones, often tied to affiliate codes signaling direct endorsement.

Value-driven statements positioned items like Simply Posh Black Cherry as "worth it" for pigmentation at accessible prices, with early hype around unreleased collections (Cosmic Beauty Starlight) implying rising demand.

Visual proofs of performance, such as swatches over tattoos (battybean) and eye applications (Heather Austin, Rachel Palmieri), clustered around high-impact shimmers, fostering enthusiasm for indies over mainstream duplicates.

These signals suggest sales drivers for an indie store include thematic novelty and formula reliability, particularly in eyeshadows and lips, where comfortable wear and shift encourage repeat buys.

## 6. Opportunities for the Store

Stock eyeshadow palettes like Simply Posh Black Cherry and Blend Bunny Rotten, where demand rises from positive pigmentation and unique themes; consider Bella Beauté Bar Dark Dreamscape for its versatile shimmers and highlighters, as sentiment patterns show strong cross-creator adoption.

Rising demand appears in fall-toned indies (Nomad Pacific Northwest, Gourmande Girls Nevermore) for moody aesthetics, suggesting bundling with lip liners (e.g., Singe Evocative) to capitalize on combo trends.

Reviews were consistently negative on repackaged mainstream sets (Natasha Denona), highlighting gaps in fresh, non-dupe neutrals—fill this with indie alternatives like Dede Signature From The Roots for muted pops.

Market gaps include affordable multichrome options, as creators noted high prices in Danessa Myricks; stock accessible indies to address this while avoiding emollient shimmers criticized for creasing.
