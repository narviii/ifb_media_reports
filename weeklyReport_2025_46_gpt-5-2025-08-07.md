# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

The key takeaway: During Nov 10–16, 2025, conversation was dominated by Oden’s Eye’s Ice Crystal palette launch, while short-form “combo” content (lip and blush) and holiday value sets amplified purchase urgency. Shimmer quality, discount stacking, and seasonal aesthetics were the week’s clearest demand drivers.

## 1. Overview

- Launch energy was high but pragmatic: creators pushed affiliate codes and Black Friday stackability while simultaneously cautioning against FOMO and overspending. Several creators are actively decluttering or on no-buy, signaling a more selective buyer mindset.
- Texture talk led the week. Specialty shimmers/multichromes and pastel mattes were repeatedly evaluated on payoff, adherence, and chunkiness; adhesives/primers were positioned as essential companions.
- Lips and cheeks were “built” rather than worn singularly. Lip-liner + liquid lip + gloss “recipes,” and cream + powder blush layering, were frequent, visual, and replicable—strong micro-triggers for single-SKU add-ons.
- Skepticism surfaced around luxury minimalism and “manufactured” categories (Outside-In pricing; toddler skincare backlash). Value and uniqueness (indie formulas, affordable multichrome singles, holiday sets) won attention.
- Seasonal shift is clear: icy/frosty eye looks, swamp-core greens, moody gothic stories, and nostalgic collabs (Shrek, Bratz) framed most color narratives.

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

- Oden’s Eye Ice Crystal Palette (Sweden, indie) — strong positive momentum
  - Cross-creator saturation (Heather Austin, Angelica Nyqvist, battybean, Rachel Palmieri). 
  - Sentiment: largely positive for matte blendability and sparkle complexity; mixed notes on a few “squishy/chunky” shimmers and desire for a deeper matte. One creator found the palette light-leaning for personal taste but still praised aesthetic/quality.
  - Context: LE holiday launch timed with Black Friday; affiliate code stacking; “wintery colorful” story (cool pastels + warm accents). Multiple creators provided multi-look tutorials and application tactics (adhesives, cut-crease for hooded eyes).
  - Hype cycle: peak launch week; palette is becoming a comparison point for seasonal icy color stories.

- Fantasy Cosmetica (US indie): Cradled in Ice + The Witch’s Familiar — positive
  - Used in tandem; praised for pigment and synergy with icy tones (palette pairing narrative).

- Klarity Kosmetics The Other Side (US indie): 12-pan — positive
  - Highly pigmented swatches on tattooed skin; moody/goth aesthetic resonated.

- Dieverune (indie): Bizarre Botanicals palette + Ghost Orchid highlight — positive
  - Strong payoff in jewel tones; high-impact duochrome highlighter spotlighted; gems used as embellishments.

- Jolie Beauty x Ozzy (UK indie): palette — positive
  - Autumnal warm smoky looks; affiliate-backed; metallic payoff emphasized.

- Lip products (multiple indie/mainstream):
  - Liner-led combos: Unearthly Foggy (cool nude), Melt Mocha, Rare Beauty Wise — positive
  - Main lip layers: Dose of Colors Stone/Cork (renewed attention), Menagerie Leo (explicit “top fave”), Blend Bunny Moody, Menagerie Artemis (paired with icy eye) — positive
  - Gloss toppers: Lethal Patch Gloss and Lawless Happy Thoughts/Forget the Filler — positive
  - Pattern: visual “recipe” content drives interest in exact pairings.

- Eye support products:
  - Adhesives/primers: NYX Glitter Primer, Clionadh Shine On, Melt Eye Base — normalized as required for special shimmers.

- Other notable pulses:
  - Juvia’s Place Culture multichrome singles ($15) — positive value narrative.
  - ColourPop x Shrek palette — positive swatch reception; nostalgia lever.
  - ONE/SIZE Powder Melt Glass Setting Spray — strong endorsement vs MAC Fix+ (function-specific).
  - Danessa Myricks Lightwork VII — mixed to negative on chunky texture vs better/cheaper indie shimmers.

Clusters observed:
- “Lots of creators testing Ice Crystal” with repeat praise for mattes and sparkle; recurring caution on a subset of chunky/gel-like shades.
- “Lip combo” clips proliferated; liners are the anchor category.
- Adhesive/primer reliance is normalized for specialty textures.
- Affordable multichrome singles are filling a demand gap.

## 3. Category Trends

- Eyeshadow Palettes: High momentum for cool/icy pastels with contrast pops (yellow/orange), and moody gothic color stories. Specialty shimmers/multichromes remain the differentiation lever.
- Lips: Defined lip architecture via liner + (liquid lip or tint) + high-shine gloss is the prevailing approach. Deep nude/terracotta and cool nude combos both trend.
- Cheeks: Layering is standard—cream/liquid blush topped with luminous powder or high-shift highlighters. Placement is high/lifted; finish is luminous, not flat.
- Eyeliners: Colored gel pencils and practical long-wear basics are resurging (Oden’s Eye Solmåne pencils used; Ravie Beauty long-wear liners anticipated).
- Seasonal signals: Icy/frost looks, swamp/moss greens (Shrek), and festive duochromes; holiday sets create value buzz.

Fatigue/skepticism:
- Palette overload acknowledged; creators on no-buy/declutters.
- Pushback on luxury-minimal launches and “manufactured” categories (toddler skincare).

## 4. Emerging Themes & Narratives

- Icy Winter Aesthetic and Contrast Color Theory (multi-creator): Cool pastels + warm accents; light-vs-dark, warm-vs-cool contrasts showcased across looks.
- Specialty Finishes as Value (multi-creator): Shimmers/multichromes are the reason-to-buy; adhesives/techniques part of the pitch.
- Affiliate Stack + Black Friday Timing (multi-creator): Stacking codes/time-bound launches used to accelerate conversion.
- Lip Combo Culture (multi-creator): Exact liner/liquid/gloss formulas framed as “perfect combos,” prompting multi-SKU baskets.
- Blush Layering (multi-creator): Cream+powder strategies for longevity and dimension normalized.
- Indie > Mainstream on Shimmers (multi-creator): Direct comparisons favored indie (Clionadh, Bella Beauté Bar) over pricier mainstream special shades.
- Conscious Consumption (multi-creator): Declutters/no-buy messaging coexists with affiliate pushes, indicating selective purchase intent rather than abstention.

Regional/brand-origin momentum:
- Swedish indie (Oden’s Eye) led the week in visibility and creator adoption.
- Western indie color houses (Fantasy Cosmetica, Klarity, Dieverune, Jolie Beauty, Menagerie, Blend Bunny) showed strong engagement.
- K-beauty influence noted in lip textures/soft liners and glossy balms; Glow Recipe shade expansion excited viewers.
- AU indie (Glaminatrix) teasing holiday palette maintained positive sentiment.

## 5. Purchase-Intent Signals

- Scarcity and Timing: LE launches aligned with Black Friday; sold-out sightings (ColourPop Grinch, NARS).
- Price/Value: Code stacking and affordable multichrome singles (Juvia’s) lowered barriers; holiday sets quantifying savings converted interest.
- Visual Proof: Short-form, high-payoff demos (icy looks, combo lips/cheeks) acted as immediate triggers.
- Authority Endorsements: “Top favs” (Menagerie Leo), repeated matte/sparkle praise (Ice Crystal), and problem-solving tips (hooded-eye cut crease).
- Dupe/Alternative Frames: ColourPop Fresh Kiss Glossy Balm compared to Summer Fridays; indie shimmers cited as superior alternatives to pricier mainstream textures.
- Cross-sell patterns: Adhesives/primers + specialty shimmers; liners + lips + gloss; cream blush + luminous topper.

Friction points dampening intent:
- Reports of chunky/peely shimmers (select Ice Crystal shades; Danessa Lightwork VII).
- Fatigue/over-collection narratives prompting restraint.

## 6. Opportunities for the Store

Stocking and curation
- Eyes/Textures:
  - Prioritize cool/icy and moody-goth palettes or curated singles. If Oden’s Eye isn’t accessible, position Fantasy Cosmetica Cradled in Ice, Klarity The Other Side, Dieverune Bizarre Botanicals, Jolie Beauty Ozzy as “icy” or “moody” alternatives.
  - Expand specialty shimmers/multichromes (pressed singles) at accessible price points; highlight “affordable multichrome” positioning.
  - Carry and bundle adhesives/primers (NYX Glitter Primer, Clionadh-style shimmer primer analogs) with specialty shadows.

- Lips:
  - Build “combo-ready” assortments:
    - Liners: cool nude, brown/taupe, terracotta (Melt/Menagerie/Unearthly analogs).
    - Liquid lips: deep nude/terracotta (Cork-like), mauve-nudes (Stone-like), seasonal browns (Menagerie Leo analog).
    - High-shine, non-gritty glosses (Lethal/Lawless analogs).
  - Pre-bundle “Exact Look” lip kits reflecting creator-favored pairings.

- Cheeks/Glow:
  - Stock cream/liquid blushes in rosy/berry and apricot, plus luminous powder blush toppers and shifty highlighters (pink/lilac/peach shifts).
  - Market “blush layering kits” for longevity and lift.

- Eyeliners/Accessories:
  - Colored gel pencils in ice blue, mint, charcoal, and basic neutrals; position as essential for icy looks.
  - Face gems and lash clusters as low-cost add-ons for festive looks.

Merchandising and content
- Seasonal bundles:
  - “Icy Eye Kit” (cool mattes + shimmer topper + adhesive + pastel liner + gems).
  - “Moody Goth Kit” (deep mattes, jewel shimmers, black/burgundy lip).
  - “Swamp Core Green Edit” (mossy greens, duochrome mint topper).

- Visual proof:
  - Swatch photography (including on tattooed/deeper skin) and finger-application demos for shimmers.
  - Short-form reels showing exact lip and blush combos using stocked SKUs.

Pricing/promo strategy
- Time-bound stackable discounts on kits to mirror creator messaging.
- Promote value in indie shimmers vs mainstream “special shade” pricing.

Risk management (avoid/limit)
- Be cautious with palettes known for chunky/peely textures; vet shimmer formulas before committing depth.
- Skip toddler/children skincare and overly minimal, high-priced complexion entries unless there’s clear pull.
- Mascaras with negative creator feedback (e.g., Milk KUSH Big Hit) should not be priority.

Gap fills
- Affordable multichrome singles (if Juvia’s Place isn’t wholesale-accessible, source comparable indie singles).
- High-shine, non-sticky gloss options; terracotta/brown liquid lips; cool-toned nude liners.
- Shimmer adhesives/primers are undersupplied in many indie stores; they convert shimmer success.

Overall: Lean into icy/moody eye stories, combo-driven lips/cheeks, and value-forward shimmers with the right support products. Bundle for outcomes, not just SKUs, and match the visual, replicable style creators used to trigger purchases this week.
