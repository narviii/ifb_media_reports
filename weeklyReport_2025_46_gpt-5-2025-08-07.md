# Weekly Instagram Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key Takeaway: Nov 10–16, 2025 saw holiday sparkle go full throttle: icy, ethereal shimmers and grungy browns co-led the feed. Indie launches (Terra Moons “Night of the Leonids,” Oden’s Eye Ice Crystal) and the MOB Beauty x Courtney “Reverie” drop drove the week’s strongest purchase intent.

## 1. Overview

- The Vibe:
  - Launch-heavy week with swatch carousels and live-swatch reels dominating, punctuated by fast GRWMs and technique-led base videos.
  - Visuals skewed “ethereal frost” by day (icy blue/lilac/teal shifts) and “whimsygoth/grunge” by night (taupe/espresso smoke, chocolate lips, purple shimmers).
  - Notable cross-pollination: K-beauty cushions for glow control and C-beauty chrome toppers for high-beam effects.

- Engagement Temperature:
  - Warm to hot. “Link please,” “Ordered,” “I need this,” and “Is this limited?” peppered comments on Reverie, Shine by SD restock, Terra Moons, Oden’s Eye, and KIKO holiday.
  - High tutorial appetite: short, fix-it education (crease repair; glow-without-grease) earned saves and “super helpful” feedback.
  - Gloss content and affordable dupes triggered ongoing Q&A (“Is there a cheaper alternative?” “Where can I get KIKO?” “Try-on please”).

## 5. Opportunities for the Store

- Stocking Recommendations:
  - Multichrome singles and toppers with varied particle sizes: focus on Terra Moons-style shades (Celestine Dust, Tempel, Leonid Spark analogs) and Shine by SD-esque forest/ethereal hues.
  - Icy holiday palettes: Oden’s Eye–style “Ice Crystal” color stories; include “sparkly black” and jewel teals.
  - Sparkle sticks and balms: KIKO-like glitter sticks; cream sparkle balms for “wet” highlight on eyes/face.
  - Brown/mauve gloss wardrobe: Fenty/Rare Beauty analogs plus a chocolate gloss (MOB “Linger” vibe); pair with neutral/mauve liners.
  - Cream/liquid cheek: Huda Baby Pink blush lookalikes; Armani/Haus Labs-style dewy blushers; blue/lilac and warm “fire opal” highlighters.
  - K-beauty base edits: glow cushion + targeted highlight cushion (HERA), WAKEMAKE Spatula Conceal BB; Banila Co lip base for tone-neutral lips.
  - Affordable sparkle: Moira Dreamlight highlighters, Catrice swirl highlight for drugstore “luxury sparkle.”

- Content Strategy:
  - Live swatch reels with labels and macro closeups convert best for sparkles; include particle-size callouts and eye looks plus “link” on-screen.
  - Side-by-side comparisons: brown gloss vs brown gloss; blue/lilac highlight lineup; “dupe” tests for luxury sparkle (PMG/Dior).
  - 30–60 sec technique shorts: “Repair your creases” and “Glow without grease”—utility earns saves/shares.
  - “Two-tone in 2 steps” and “nail charm as eye jewel” quick hacks for holiday.
  - Create shoppable lists (Benable-style) to answer recurring “Link please” without DM friction.

- Gap Analysis:
  - Gloss fatigue: offer non-sticky, cushiony formulas with decent wear and balmy tints for “thin lips” audiences.
  - Availability friction: KIKO and select collabs are region-limited; stock comparable sparkle sticks and indie toppers.
  - Shade guidance: cushion oxidation/shade variance education and sampler cards could reduce returns.
  - Budget pressure: bundle mini multis + liner for “holiday sparkle under $25” sets; promote drugstore dupes prominently.

## 6. Special insights

- Emerging Micro-Trends:
  - Two-tone eyes (complimentary brights with opposing iridescents), often pink vs green.
  - “Whimsygoth” glam: mauve-violet shimmers + chocolate gloss + soft grunge skin.
  - Speckled pens/faux freckles and colored mascaras (blue) as playful finishes.

- Unexpected Pairings:
  - Multichrome eyeshadows used as highlighters and lip toppers (Sheen Effect, Terra Moons on lips/cheeks).
  - Cream clay eyeshadow (MOB “Memento”) doubled as blush.
  - Lip base to erase natural lip tone before liner/gloss for truer nude outcomes.

- Creative insight:
  - Lean into “wet sparkle” kits: pair a transparent sparkle balm, a medium-particle iridescent single, and a sparkly black—mirrors the exact looks driving saves.
  - Add touch-up tools to carts: mini powder puffs, travel brushes, and non-alcoholic mists to support the “repair, don’t prevent” narrative that resonated this week.
  - Curate an “Icy Prism” edit (lilac/teal/blue toppers, lilac highlight, pastel mattes) and a “Forest Grunge” edit (taupe/olive/gold sparkles, deep taupe base, chocolate gloss). Both map 1:1 to how creators are styling now.
