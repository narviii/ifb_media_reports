# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

The week of September 22-28, 2025, highlighted a surge in spooky-themed indie launches, with creators building anticipation for October releases amid seasonal shifts toward Halloween aesthetics.

## 1. Overview

Creators leaned into fall and Halloween vibes, generating excitement around indie collaborations with witchy, gothic themes. Discussions centered on vibrant color stories and high-performance formulas, particularly in eyeshadows, with repeated praise for pigmentation and blendability.

Fatigue appeared in critiques of overly thick or mismatched foundation shades, but this was offset by enthusiasm for cream-based products offering blurred, dewy finishes. Influencer skepticism surfaced around reformulated items, like powders shifting to talc-free compositions, prompting ingredient scrutiny.

Value-driven comparisons emerged, with creators noting affordable indie options rivaling mainstream brands in quality. Regional signals pointed to strong Western indie momentum, while K-beauty influences showed in blended blush techniques.

Hype cycles positioned new releases like spooky palettes at peak anticipation, with cross-creator alignment on their versatility for dramatic looks.

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

Top mentioned indie products included Fantasy Cosmetica x Battybean's The Witch's Familiar eyeshadow palette, praised across creators for its pigmented mattes (e.g., Feline, Coven) and multidimensional shimmers (e.g., Altar, Oracle, Moonlight). Sentiment was overwhelmingly positive, focusing on creamy textures, easy blending, and unique shifts in teal, purple, and red tones; no negative clusters noted.

Lethal Cosmetics x The Conjuring collection drew mixed-positive sentiment, with the Music Box highlighter lauded for its peach glow and thematic appeal, though some creators flagged minor formula dryness in reds.

Blend Bunny x Mei Pang's Rotten palette and Efflorescence topper saw positive buzz for novelty and hype, often compared as upgrades to discontinued items like Muerta, with clusters of creators testing for longevity and value.

Glamnetic's Red Bottom press-on nails received positive feedback for matte black finish and luxury red underside, emphasizing ease of application and dramatic stiletto shape.

Repeat criticism was minimal, but foundation mismatches (e.g., Charlotte Tilbury's yellow-leaning neutrals) created small negative clusters.

## 3. Category Trends

Eyeshadow palettes dominated momentum, with creators gravitating toward vibrant, jewel-toned mattes and shifty multichromes in spooky themes; textures favored creamy blends over dry formulas.

Blush categories showed rising interest in cream and liquid formats (e.g., fwee's Blurry Pudding Pot, Rare Beauty liquids), leaning into dewy, blurred aesthetics for fall glow without heaviness.

Highlighters and toppers gained traction for wet-look sheen, with fatigue around overly matte options; seasonal shifts signaled demand for peach and iridescent tones to counter cooler weather.

Lip products, including liners and mattes (e.g., Morphe's comfort mattes), trended toward pinky nudes and plumping effects, with no notable skepticism.

Nail categories emerged with edgy, gothic designs like stiletto press-ons, aligning with seasonal dark glam.

## 4. Emerging Themes & Narratives

- Indie collaborations drove cross-creator excitement, with at least three channels (battybean, Rachel Palmieri, Heather Austin, Angelica Nyqvist) aligning on Fantasy Cosmetica x Battybean's witchy aesthetic, signaling rising momentum for Western indie brands through personalized, thematic releases.
- Spooky season/Halloween themes appeared in multiple videos, featuring occult imagery (black cats, potions) and dark fantasy color stories, indicating seasonal demand spikes and positive sentiment toward gothic styles.

## 5. Purchase-Intent Signals

Strong "I'd buy this" sentiment clustered around Fantasy Cosmetica x Battybean's palette, driven by FOMO from October 1 launch details and endorsements of its high-quality shimmers as hard-to-dupe.

Repeat enthusiasm for spooky-themed items like Lethal Cosmetics' highlighter implied rising demand, with creators citing thematic appeal and performance as worth the price.

Early hype built around unreleased collections (e.g., Nomad's Pacific Northwest, Gourmande Girls' spooky drops), with signals of purchase intent tied to seasonal relevance and affiliate codes.

Value perceptions favored indie options for blending ease and pigmentation, potentially driving sales for stores stocking versatile palettes amid fall transitions.

## 6. Opportunities for the Store
