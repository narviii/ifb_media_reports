# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key Takeaway: Indie, horror-coded palettes with complex “wet-look” shimmers dominated attention while creators balanced goth lips with baby‑doll blush and cream sculpting. Purchase behavior was tempered by shipping friction and palette redundancy, making creator codes, restocks, and curated bundles the strongest conversion levers.

## 1. Overview

Creators extended “spooky season” into late October with a heavy indie focus and IP tie-ins (IT, The Shining, The Conjuring, Saw). The week felt maximalist on eyes (grunge, celestial, aquatic), but pragmatic in buying: repeated reminders to avoid FOMO and skip redundant palettes.

Texture talk outweighed shade talk: multichrome/duochrome shimmers described as “sparkly, wet-looking,” paired with matte-heavy builds. Mattes are expected to be soft, blendable, and beginner-friendly; basic beige inserts in colorful palettes drew criticism.

Lips split into two lanes: alt/goth (grey/black, deep burgundy, brown-liner-led combos) and high-shine toppers; short-form “lip combo” reels acted as direct shopping lists. Cheeks skewed bright (baby-pink/pop blush) and luminous layering, while complexion buzz centered on creamy sculpt/underpainting.

Logistics visibly influenced decisions: international shipping costs for AU/UK indies suppressed purchases unless products felt “perfect,” though newly improved US distribution (e.g., Glaminatrix US warehouse) reduced friction. Holiday sets and sitewide sales introduced value comparisons that indie stores must counter with curation and bundles.

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

- Top mentioned indie products
  - Bella Beauté Bar Come Play With Us (The Shining): multiple showcases, strong swatch/application proof; theme resonant, blue-heavy color story polarizing for some.
  - Arttitude Cosmetics Submerged: multi‑creator swatches/looks; dark aquatic jewel tones; clear “available now + code” push; high-impact shimmers.
  - Gourmand Girls Nevermore: cross‑creator favorite; ranked #1 in a 12‑palette ranking; becoming a default goth/grunge comparison point.
  - Lethal x The Conjuring: praised in tutorial looks; mixed in rankings due to “unnecessary beige” pans; still delivers dramatic smokey results.
  - Glaminatrix x Monolith Crown Legacy: positively received; brand visibility boosted by discontinuation sale news and US warehouse note.
  - Dede’s Signature From the Roots: lauded color concept/textures; docked by some for neutral inserts.
  - Melt Welcome to Derry (IT): strong thematic pull and pigmented swatches, but repeated knocks for “basic” shimmers versus newer indie textures.
  - Singe Beauty Paisley Hoot + Lip Pencils: palette praised as “spicy neutrals” with wet shimmers; full-range lip-pencil swatches driven by audience demand.
  - Dieverune Bizarre Botanicals + Lip Muds: rising visibility; unique shades (grey/black) and comfortable “lip mud” finish.

- Sentiment trends
  - Positive: Nevermore, Submerged, Crown Legacy, Paisley Hoot, Bizarre Botanicals, Singe Lip Pencils.
  - Mixed: Conjuring (beige pans), Melt Derry (theme love, shimmer quality lag), Bella Beauté Bar Come Play With Us (quality high; blue-heavy story split viewers).
  - Notable repeats: praise for Blend Bunny/Nomad mattes as “supreme/beginner-friendly”; skepticism toward all‑shimmer/topper‑only palettes (lower reach).

- Context/hype cycle
  - “Lots of creators testing” Arttitude Submerged and Bella Beauté Bar pre/post launch drove peak curiosity.
  - Nevermore sits in sustained advocacy (multiple looks, top rankings) indicating ongoing sell-through potential.
  - Horror/IP collabs convert collectors but scrutiny on formula sophistication is rising; shimmers must compete with indie multichrome leaders.

- Repeat criticisms
  - “War against beige” in colorful palettes; filler neutrals lower perceived value.
  - Light mattes underperforming in some accessible brands; all-shimmer palettes seen as less useful for complete looks.
  - International shipping costs remain a purchase blocker unless distribution improves.

## 3. Category Trends

- Momentum categories: Eyeshadow palettes (indie, themed, multichrome-heavy) led decisively. Lip liners and deep/alt lip colors surged via short “combo” content. Eye toppers/glitter puffs and multichrome enhancers featured as add-ons.
- Textures/aesthetics: Wet-look/reflective shimmers; matte-heavy bases; blurred “lip muds”; glossy toppers over deep lips; grunge/goth/whimsigoth; dark aquatic/mermaidcore.
- Fatigue/skepticism: Blue-heavy palettes alienate some buyers; palette redundancy discourages purchases; topper-only palettes see lower practical use.
- Seasonal shift: Horror themes bridged into holiday; value sets and site sales reframed spending; distributors/US warehouses for AU/UK indies altered feasibility.

## 4. Emerging Themes & Narratives

- Horror/IP collabs convert beyond Halloween: IT, The Shining, The Conjuring, Saw appeared across creators; collectability + aesthetics drive interest even post‑launch.
- Indie shimmer superiority: Complex, “wet” multichromes are the differentiator; mainstream shimmers called “basic” in comparison.
- Conscious curation over hauls: Multiple creators publicly skip due to redundancy, price, or shipping—audiences reward transparency; purchase intent concentrates on standout items.
- Logistics as strategy: High AU/UK shipping depresses conversion; US warehouse/restock notes (e.g., Glaminatrix) reignite interest.
- Lip liner–led stacks: Brown/cool nude liners + deep lip colors + gloss toppers are a cross‑creator default; grey/black lips normalize within alt looks.
- Cream sculpt/underpainting + baby‑doll blush: Cream contour palettes and bright pink blush placements trend; glow toppers layered over powder.
- Brand-origin visibility: Western indie strength (US: BBB, Gourmand, Unearthly, Nomad; DE: Lethal; UK: Arttitude, Jolie; AU: Glaminatrix). K/J/C‑beauty absent this week.

## 5. Purchase-Intent Signals

- High conviction endorsements: Nevermore ranked #1 and repeatedly used; Submerged featured by multiple creators with “available now” plus codes; Bella Beauté Bar launch content with heavy swatch proof.
- “This is worth it” rationales: “Supreme/beginner-friendly” mattes (Blend Bunny, Nomad); “sparkly, wet-looking” special shades; clear themed narratives (Wednesday/whimsigoth, aquatic).
- Lip conversions: Viewer‑requested Singe lip-pencil swatches; grey/black Dieverune Lip Muds; liner–lip–gloss recipes shown step‑by‑step drive basket adds.
- Urgency levers: Launch dates (Oct 23 Submerged; Oct 26 Come Play With Us), discontinuation sales (Glaminatrix), seasonal sitewide promos (indie + majors).
- Friction reducers: Domestic shipping/US warehousing announcements and affiliate codes materially shift “maybe later” into “add to cart.”

## 6. Opportunities for the Store

- Prioritize indie palette anchors
  - Secure/expand: Gourmand Girls Nevermore; Arttitude Submerged; Glaminatrix (capitalize on US stock where possible); Dede’s From The Roots; Singe Paisley Hoot. If Bella Beauté Bar’s Come Play With Us is accessible, list with waitlist alerts.
  - Buy notes: Favor matte-heavy palettes with complex shimmers. De‑prioritize topper‑only palettes and those padded with beige/bone shades.

- Build alt lip architecture
  - Range add: Cool/neutral brown lip liners; deep burgundy, charcoal/grey, and black lip formulas (e.g., “lip mud” textures); high‑shine non‑gritty gloss toppers.
  - Merchandising: Pre‑built “lip combo” trios (liner + lipstick + gloss). Feature creator‑named combos on PDPs.

- Sell the sparkle system
  - Stock multichrome singles/toppers and the supporting enhancers/primers (glitter adhesives, shimmer bases). Cross‑sell with every palette PDP (“Get the wet look”).

- Theme-forward curation
  - Curate bundles by micro‑aesthetic: “Wednesday‑core,” “Spooky Plants,” “Mermaid‑Grunge.” Include gems/stickers as low-cost add‑ons seen in looks.

- Counter shipping friction
  - Aggregate AU/UK indie inventory domestically; message “Ships from US—no international fees/delays.” Offer combined‑brand bundles to amortize shipping for the customer.

- Calendar and inventory tactics
  - Use waitlists and limited preorders for hot drops (Submerged‑like profiles) and restocks (Nevermore‑like). Time promos adjacent to major retail events with value bundles rather than blanket discounts.

- Avoid/limit
  - Heavy buys of all‑shimmer/topper palettes; palettes with redundant light mattes; blue‑dominant stories without broader balance; warm/orange‑leaning bronzers with narrow tone flexibility.

- Quick wins
  - Add stick‑on face gems and high‑adhesion eye bases (frequent in looks).
  - Introduce bright baby‑pink blush options (cream + luminous powder layer) from indie sources to capture the mainstream‑visible trend through an indie lens.

This week’s media signals point to sustained demand for themed indie palettes with advanced shimmer tech, liner‑led lip wardrobes in alt tones, and accessory products that unlock “editorial” finishes—provided stores actively solve the logistics and curation problems creators keep flagging.
