# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key Takeaway: Indie color launches dominated with moody, witchy palettes and high-shine textures; creators layered blush aggressively and gravitated to cool tones/olive neutrals. Licensed collabs and creator-led drops are converting, while mainstream neutrals face originality skepticism.

## 1. Overview

This week was decisively “spooky-season”: horror IPs, witchcore packaging, and grunge-leaning palettes drove creator attention and audience excitement. The energy skewed high for indie collabs with vivid tutorials and heavy affiliate-code activity.

Texture talk was constant. Multichrome/iridescent shimmers that read “wet” and reflective were praised across indie and even mainstream (Patrick Ta), while softer satin metallics drew caveats. Layered blush (cream + powder) with high, lifted placement was repeatedly showcased in short-form.

Complexion fatigue persists around repetitive neutral palettes; some creators celebrated Makeup by Mario’s warmer Nature/olive updates, others called it derivative. Value framing continued: creators positioned indie-level sparkle at various price points and offered alt options/dupes.

Market notes: Flower Beauty’s closure reinforced celebrity-brand volatility; Sigma’s Ulta rollout and Lethal’s new US warehouse improved access. Giftable holiday sets and body mists (Fenty) signaled seasonal shift beyond eye looks.

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

- Top mentioned indie products
  - Fantasy Cosmetica x Battybean The Witch’s Familiar (palette): Ubiquitous across multiple videos; centerpiece of the week’s goth/witch trend. Sentiment: strong positive (pigment, multichromes, packaging).
  - Singe Beauty Paisley Hoot (palette) + Evocative Lip Liners: Repeated visibility (brand owner + reviewers). “Neutral with a 70s twist” (mustards/olives) and hard-to-find cool-toned liners. Sentiment: strong positive.
  - Lethal x The Conjuring (palette, highlighter, primer, liners, powder, lipstick): High interest for IP and packaging. Performance split: palette/highlighter/primer positive; liners’ felt-tip thickness and powder texture mixed; black lipstick flagged as sheer. Sentiment: mixed-to-positive.
  - Blend Bunny x Mei Pang (Rotten matte palette, Efflorescence iridescent palette): Praised for blendable mattes and dry, high-shift iridescents that layer cleanly; Blue Tears lip glaze performance fine but shade polarizing. Sentiment: positive (lip glaze mixed).
  - Bella Beauté Bar Dark Dreamscape (20-pan, multichrome highlighter, lip sparkle balms): Strong enthusiasm for palette versatility and the “no-grit” sparkle balms. The multichrome highlighter earned standout raves across creators. Sentiment: strong positive.
  - Nomad Pacific Northwest (palette): Visual swatches impressed; deep greens/teals and specialty shimmers resonated. Sentiment: positive.
  - Gourmande Girls x Doodle By The Bunny Nevermore (palette): Repeated mentions as a “smart, moody” release. Sentiment: positive.
  - Unearthly Holiday Mystery Bundles: Cool-toned winter palettes + FOMO preorders. Sentiment: positive.

- Mainstream touchpoints shaping indie demand
  - Patrick Ta Eye Illusion Duos: Applauded as “indie sparkle at Sephora” with robust comparisons to cheaper sparkle sticks/liquids. Sentiment: positive and positioned as a texture benchmark.
  - Makeup by Mario Ethereal Eyes: Nature: Split reception—one creator praised formula and olives; another questioned originality and pricing confusion. Sentiment: mixed overall.

- Note clusters
  - “Witch’s Familiar” is becoming the default comparison point for fall alternative looks (multiple demos; high cross-creator visibility).
  - Recurrent praise for multichrome highlighters (Bella Beauté Bar, Lethal); demand for “no base cast,” glossy/wet finish.
  - Repeat criticism around Lethal’s setting powder (unusual gel-to-powder feel, initial pilling) and felt-tip liner thickness; black lipstick sheerness flagged.
  - “Palette fatigue” mentioned, but moody/cool and olive-leaning neutrals cut through.

- Context drivers
  - Performance: blendability of deep mattes and high-reflect shimmers is the purchase driver; iridescents preferred “dry,” non-squishy.
  - Novelty: licensed IP, creator collabs, and magnetic/customizable formats elevate perceived value.
  - Value: creators offered cheaper sparkle alternatives; codes widely used; stocking convenience (Sigma at Ulta; Lethal US warehouse) cited.

## 3. Category Trends

- Momentum categories
  - Eyeshadow palettes dominate: gothic/witchy, nature/grunge, and cool-toned color stories (teals, purples, olives, blurples).
  - High-shine textures: multichromes/iridescents for “wet” lids; specialty shimmers and toppers as must-haves.
  - Blush: aggressive layering of cream + powder for lift and longevity; mauves/berries and rusty browns trending.
  - Lips: growth in lip liners (cool taupes/ash for contour); moody browns/reds and sparkly balms; appetite for opaque black remains unmet by some launches.

- Aesthetics
  - Witchcore/goth, 70s earth tones, PNW nature, and Y2K sparkly/cool looks.
  - Lifted blush draping toward temples; deep, sculpted lips with liner-led combos.

- Fatigue/skepticism
  - “Another neutral palette” skepticism unless there’s an olive twist or special textures.
  - Mixed reception for novel base textures (gel-powder setting) and chunky shimmers.

- Seasonal shift
  - Halloween IPs/collabs peaking; early holiday gifting talk (Glossier sets, Pat McGrath minis).
  - Body fragrance/body mists interest rising (Fenty scents).

## 4. Emerging Themes & Narratives

- Creator x Indie Collabs as conversion engines: Fantasy Cosmetica x Battybean; Blend Bunny x Mei Pang. Strong community loyalty and urgency.
- Licensed IP drives cart adds: Lethal x The Conjuring, Glamlite x Saw (mentioned). Packaging/collectibility matter.
- Cool tones/greens/olives resurgence: Appearing across indie palettes and MbM; moody greens and teals are consistent winners.
- Indie sparkle mainstreaming: Patrick Ta’s duos framed as “indie-like sparkle at Sephora,” validating the texture trend and broadening demand.
- Blush layering standardization: Multiple creators stacked cream + powder; high placement normalization across content.
- Accessibility upgrades: Lethal’s US warehouse and Sigma’s Ulta distribution reduce friction and spur trial.
- Dupe/nostalgia discourse: ABH Mini Embers positioned as the modern Master Palette by Mario; MbM Nature debated for originality.
- Market volatility for celebrity brands: Flower Beauty closure discussed by multiple creators; audience caution heightening.

Regional signals and brand-origin momentum:
- Western indie dominance (US/EU): Fantasy Cosmetica, Bella Beauté Bar, Blend Bunny, Nomad, Gourmande Girls, Unearthly—all rising in visibility.
- EU indie expansion: Lethal (Germany) increases US accessibility; Oden’s Eye (Sweden) shows up in blush trends.
- K-beauty presence as sparkle sticks/comparisons (Unleashia) rather than headlining launches.

## 5. Purchase-Intent Signals

  - Lethal x The Conjuring palette and Music Box Highlighter (IP + performance + new US warehouse).
  - Gourmande Girls Nevermore, Nomad PNW (moody greens/blues; specialty shimmers).

- Conversion levers
  - Scarcity/seasonality: collabs, Halloween themes, limited bundles (Unearthly preorders).
  - Texture proof: on-eye swatches, glitter glue tips, “dry” iridescent preference, no-cast highlighters.
  - Codes and convenience: affiliate savings everywhere; distribution improvements reduce friction.
  - Nostalgia: ABH Mini Embers as a modern Mario stand-in; collectors motivated.

- Potential drags
  - Sheer black lipsticks when opacity expected.

  - Neutral palettes without distinguishing textures or an olive/green anchor.

## 6. Opportunities for the Store

- Stocking priorities (immediate)
  - Witchy/grunge palettes with special-effect shimmers: Fantasy Cosmetica, Bella Beauté Bar, Nomad, Gourmande Girls, Unearthly (cool-toned winter). Curate a “Spooky Season: Teal, Purple, Olive” capsule.
  - Multichrome highlighters and toppers: Bella Beauté Bar Dark Dreamscape Highlighter; seek “no base cast” SKUs with glossy, wet finishes.
  - Iridescent toppers (dry, transparent base): Align with Blend Bunny Efflorescence texture preferences.
  - Cool-toned and sculpting lip liners: Focus on ash/taupe/rosewood neutrals (mirror Singe’s shades) to meet clear market gaps.
  - Deep/moody lips: Brown-reds and true opaque blacks; avoid sheer blacks unless marketed as balm/blur.

- Attachments and bundles
  - “Shimmer Optimizer” add-ons: glitter glue/adhesive, pencil brushes, eye bases; bundle with multichrome palettes to raise AOV.
  - Blush layering kits: Pair high-pigment liquid/cream with matching powder (offer indie alternatives to Rare Beauty/Lawless; include Blend Bunny Pro Blush or similar). Educate on lifted placement.
  - Magnetic/customizable formats: Offer empty magnetics and singles to ride Bella Beauté Bar’s customization appeal.

- Seasonal merchandising
  - Limited-edition/creator-collab hub: Elevate collab launches with countdowns and code callouts; emphasize restock plans where applicable.
  - Giftable sparkle sets: Curate “Indie Sparkle at Multiple Price Points” as a response to Patrick Ta interest; include sticks/liquids for entry-level shimmer.

- Sourcing and partnerships
  - EU indie with US-friendly logistics: Lean into Lethal now that a US warehouse exists; position as easy-access EU indie.
  - Tools that drive results: Precision eye brushes and pencil smudgers (Sigma-style equivalents) to support smoky/wing and lower-lash work.

- What to de-emphasize or scrutinize
  - Sheer black lip bullets framed as opaque—expect returns/complaints.
  - Chunky shimmer formulas and overly emollient iridescents; creators prefer thin, reflective, “dry-feel” shifts.
  - Redundant neutral palettes without texture novelty or an olive/green hook.

- Content/UX tweaks
  - Education tiles: “How to get the wet-lid look” (glitter glue + topper), “Blush stacking for all-day wear,” “Cool-tone capsule: teal, periwinkle, slate.”
  - Clear code stacking and shipping transparency; highlight fast shipping on EU indie brands to reduce friction.

Overall: Lean into moody greens/teals/purples, indie-level sparkle, and layered blush. Prioritize creator-collab and licensed seasonal drops, reinforce with the right tools and adhesives, and fill the lip-liner gap with cool sculpting neutrals.
