# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

Key Takeaway: Week of Sep 29–Oct 5, 2025 saw indie-led, spooky-season dominance: witchy/grunge palettes, multichrome textures, and blush stacking drove attention and purchase intent. Mainstream responded with high-sparkle and olive neutrals, but creator sentiment split on originality versus value.

## 1. Overview

Indie color stories owned the week. Multiple creators rallied around moody greens, teals, purples, and reds packaged in seasonal, collector-forward IP or creator collabs. Texture talk centered on reflective, non-chunky shimmers and multichromes that read “wet” without grit.

Blush layering is back in force. Short-form demos showed cream + powder “stacking” for saturation and longevity, with lifted placement to temple. Viewers were given concrete pairings (Lawless/Rare Beauty + Oden’s Eye/Blend Bunny), priming a bundle-friendly sales moment.

Complexion discourse skewed pragmatic: experimental textures (Lethal’s cream-to-powder set) divided opinion and were reframed for specific skin types. Highlighters with no base cast and non-gritty sparkle got consistent praise.

Creator skepticism surfaced around neutrality fatigue and pricing. Makeup by Mario’s Nature palette drew polarized takes—“uninspired repeat” from indie reviewers vs. “best yet” from a mainstream-leaning reviewer—highlighting audience segmentation. Dupe/alt recommendations persisted for premium sparkle (Patrick Ta).

Operational/market signals mattered: Lethal’s US warehouse, Sigma’s Ulta rollout, and Fantasy Cosmetica’s cross-border stockists all lowered friction and increased access. Flower Beauty’s closure reinforced celebrity-brand volatility.

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

- Fantasy Cosmetica x Battybean “The Witch’s Familiar” (Eyeshadow Palette)
  - Sentiment: overwhelmingly positive across multiple uploads; centerpiece of the week’s buzz.
  - Context: deep teals/purples/reds + multichrome toppers; strong seasonal “witchcore” pull; needs glitter glue for max payoff; stocked internationally (Monolith EU, Ifeelbeautiful CA).
  - Hype position: peak launch window; creator-owned validation and repeated tutorials drive conversions.

- Lethal Cosmetics x The Conjuring (Palette, Highlighter, Primer; Powder/Liners mixed)
  - Sentiment: positive on palette and Music Box Highlighter; primer positive; setting powder and black lipstick mixed; liner stamps fun but felt-tip thickness criticized.
  - Context: IP packaging as collector hook; cool-toned story with standout multichrome; US warehouse removes tariffs/shipping friction (US demand tailwind).
  - Hype position: strong seasonal relevance; “accessible EU indie” narrative aids adoption.

- Blend Bunny x Mei Pang (Rotten matte palette; Efflorescence iridescent palette; Blue Tears lip glaze)
  - Sentiment: palettes positive; lip glaze mixed (great texture, niche shade).
  - Context: compact sizes praised; dry-feel iridescents perform cleanly on eyes/cheeks; “grungy” mattes distinct from prior BB launches.
  - Note: multiple creators promote Blend Bunny blush stacking (Pro Blush palette) in shorts.

- Bella Beauté Bar Dark Dreamscape (20-pan palette; Multichrome Highlighter; Lip Sparkle Balms)
  - Sentiment: positive; highlighter singled out as “top-tier” blue/purple shift; balms praised for pigment + comfort with no grit.
  - Context: brand expansion into lips validated; customizable magnetic formats.

- Singe Beauty (Paisley Hoot Palette; Evocative Lip Liners)
  - Sentiment: strong positive; “neutral with a 70s twist” and “hard-to-find cool taupe” liners resonated.
  - Context: specialized shimmers designed for textured lids; waterproof lip liners; clear launch ops (warehouse fulfillment) build trust.

- Nomad Cosmetics Pacific Northwest (Eyeshadow Palette)
  - Sentiment: positive; nature theme + specialty shimmers showcased.
  - Context: moody greens/blues and pan imprints support collector appeal.

- Gourmande Girls x Doodle By The Bunny “Nevermore” (Palette)
  - Sentiment: positive from multiple news roundups.
  - Context: grungy/purple/shift mix; fits spooky cycle.

- Unearthly Cosmetics Holiday Mystery Bundles (Cursed Winter, Shattered Snowfall)
  - Sentiment: positive; cool-toned winter appeal; mystery bundle novelty.

- Mainstream with indie influence
  - Patrick Ta Eye Illusion Duos: positive; “indie-level sparkle at Sephora,” with budget alternatives offered.
  - Makeup by Mario Ethereal Eyes: Nature: polarized (neutral fatigue vs. “best MbM yet,” loved olive shimmer); illustrates split audiences.
  - ABH Mini Embers: positive for mattes/versatility; metallics intentionally subtle (manage expectations).

- Blush ecosystem
  - Rare Beauty Liquid Blush (Chamoy/Believe): repeatedly favored as cream base.
  - Oden’s Eye powder blush; Blend Bunny Pro Blush Palette: consistent powder toppers with code incentives.

Repeat critiques and notes:
- “Chunky” or overly thick liners/pens flagged; buyers want thin, precise tips.
- Black lipstick opacity (Lethal) underwhelming without liner.
- Subtle metallics (ABH Embers) may disappoint “wet shine” seekers.

## 3. Category Trends

- Eyeshadow Palettes: High momentum continues, driven by creator/IP collabs and regional themes. Textures: multichrome/iridescent toppers prioritized; cool tones, olives, teals, and “grunge neutrals” lead.
- Blush: Layering cream + powder is the default technique for impact and wear. Lifted placement to temples (“draping”) is commonplace.
- Highlighter: Multichrome/blue-lilac shifts with no base cast are in demand; “glossy, not gritty” texture wins.
- Lips: Waterproof, cool-toned neutral lip liners and deep moody lip combos (brown/rosewood) show strong pull; balm-lipstick hybrids with sparkle gaining traction.
- Eyeliners: Stamp novelty accepted; precision still critical—thinner felt tips preferred.
- Seasonal shift: Spooky/witchy now; early winter cool-tone palettes gaining pre-holiday interest. Gifting talk begins (mini duos, bundles).

## 4. Emerging Themes & Narratives

- Indie Collab and IP Dominance (cross-creator): Fantasy Cosmetica x Battybean, Lethal x The Conjuring, Blend Bunny x Mei Pang—creator-led storytelling plus IP packaging fuels urgency and collectability.
- Cool Tones, Olives, and Grunge Neutrals (cross-creator): Repeated praise for moody greens/teals, cool purples, and olive accents; “neutral with a twist” beats standard browns.
- Mainstream Adopts Indie Sparkle (cross-creator): Patrick Ta’s reflective duos and MbM’s refined shimmers compared to indie toppers; creators still provide cheaper indie/alt options.
- Blush Stacking as Standard (cross-creator): Cream base (Rare Beauty/Lawless) + powder topper (Oden’s Eye/Blend Bunny) for saturation and endurance; high placement trend reinforced.
- Accessibility & Ops Upgrades (cross-creator): Lethal’s US warehouse, Sigma at Ulta, Fantasy Cosmetica global stockists; Singe’s third-party fulfillment—lower friction = higher conversion.
- Value vs Originality (cross-creator): Neutral fatigue and price skepticism for repeats (MbM) co-exist with strong texture-driven buys; creators actively share alternatives/dupes.
- Body/Fragrance Lightwear (multi-creator): Fenty body mists and approachable holiday sets (Glossier) indicate appetite for lighter, layerable scents.

Regional/brand-origin momentum:
- Western indie leads (US/EU): Lethal (DE) gains US traction via warehouse; Oden’s Eye (SE) visible; US indie brands (Fantasy Cosmetica, Bella Beauté Bar, Blend Bunny, Unearthly, Nomad) sustain buzz.
- Celebrity/mass volatility: Flower Beauty closure dampens confidence in celebrity-driven mass brands.

## 5. Purchase-Intent Signals

- Strongest converters:
  - Limited collabs timed to season (Witch’s Familiar; The Conjuring); creator gratitude tours + multiple looks keep momentum.
  - Affiliate codes across videos (BATTYBEAN, RACHEL, HEATHER, ANGESCHKA) with explicit savings drive immediate clicks.
  - Texture proof: multichrome/high-shine toppers with no grit; iridescent dry-feel shimmers; waterproof lip liners; blush layering success.
  - Logistics wins: Lethal US warehouse and established stockists reduce friction; Sigma at Ulta leverages points.
- Early hype:
  - Bella Beauté Bar highlighter (no base cast, dramatic shift) and Lip Sparkle Balms as comfort-pigment hybrids.
  - Singe Lip Liners (cool taupes/rosewood) filling shade gaps.
  - Olives/cool tones as holiday differentiators versus warm-neutral fatigue.
- Cautionary signals:
  - Sheer black lipsticks; stamp liners with thick tips; subtle metallics that underserve “wet look” shoppers; mainstream “repeat” palettes meeting resistance among indie-leaning audiences.

- Gaps to fill
  - Cool-toned, light taupe lip liners (consistent unmet need called out by creators).
  - Non-gritty, reflective toppers that work on textured lids (dry-touch iridescents).
