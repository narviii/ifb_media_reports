# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key Takeaway: Celestial-themed, multichrome-heavy indie launches dominated, led by Cosmic Beauty’s Starlight Collection (launched October 17), while spooky/goth aesthetics and 70s-warm neutrals coexisted. Creators split complexion preferences: dewy grip for dry skin vs. hardcore oil control for humid/oily wearers.

## 1. Overview

Indie color is the conversation. Multiple creators centered their week around high-shine, shifting textures—multichromes, glossy toppers, and “wet-look” highlighters—anchored by Cosmic Beauty’s Starlight drop. This drove a wave of affiliate-coded, launch-timed content with strong visuals and swatches over tattoos to prove opacity.

A parallel goth/spooky current persisted: matte blacks, olives, bruise tones, chartreuse and blood-red gradients (Gourmande Girls, Fantasy Cosmetica, Lethal, Unearthly). At the same time, 70s-leaning “spicy neutrals” and olives (Singe Beauty Paisley Hoot) offered a wearable on-ramp for color buyers.

Complexion talk was pragmatic, not aspirational. Dry-skin creators reaffirmed hydrating, gripping bases and glowy setting mists; oily-skin reviewers roasted award picks and pushed true mattifying solutions and long-wear foundations. Mini/sets and limited holiday drops (Sephora, ColourPop) sustained value and giftability chatter.

Influencer skepticism toward legacy accolades (Allure) and some mainstream aesthetics (Kylie “King Kylie”) contrasted with strong indie advocacy. Collectibility—lenticular covers, embossed pans, themed PR chests—mattered as much as shade curation.

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

- Top indie drivers
  - Cosmic Beauty Starlight Collection (Starlight Society 20-pan palette; Astral Radiance highlighter trio; metallic gel liners; tinted lip oils; liquid lipsticks). Sentiment: strongly positive. Context: standout multichromes, cohesive celestial theme, limited initial bundle availability (Oct 17); palette to be sold separately later. Hype peak now; heavy affiliate/code usage and multi-creator coverage.
  - Singe Beauty Paisley Hoot palette. Sentiment: positive. Context: 70s/boho warm olives, rusts; embossed pans; “high Singe quality.” Positioned as wearable-grunge alternative to goth brights; repeat swatch receipts.
  - Adept Cosmetics RHNULL palette (Oct 18). Sentiment: positive. Context: velvet mattes + complex sparkles; creators emphasized non-duplication vs. EBE/Minka; two-look demos; collector framing.
  - Gourmande Girls Nevermore. Sentiment: positive. Context: goth greens, blacks, high-impact shimmers; repeated “wow” on lime/green shift; affiliate push.
  - Blend Bunny x Mei Pang Rotten (mattes) + Efflorescence (toppers); Tears Lip Glaze; ’89 Fine Pencil. Sentiment: positive. Context: BB mattes cited as benchmark for blend/build; LE collab urgency; goth gloss lip stackability.
  - What’s Up Beauty liquid blush (Heirloom) + ultra-matte liquid lipstick. Sentiment: positive. Context: easy blend, one-swipe opacity; elevated packaging; fall tones.

- Supporting movers and notes
  - Fantasy Cosmetica (The Witch’s Familiar; Rogue): positive for deep mattes + multichrome lids (spooky/goth).
  - Lethal Cosmetics Conjuring palette positive; Lethal setting powder panned for low payoff.
  - Profusion Bellini Liquid Blush + Sigma Bronze Star powder blush combo: positive; “blush cocktailing” for longevity/value.
  - One/Size primers (Secure the Glow; Oil Sucker) + Danessa Myricks Yummy Skin Mattifying Setting Spray: repeatedly endorsed as true performance for oily wear.
  - Rare Beauty minis (Soft Pinch blush set) praised for right-sizing high pigment.
  - Urban Decay Hydromaniac, Moondust Quad: continued goodwill and purchase.
  - Holiday/value: Laneige Pumpkin Pie mask; Sol de Janeiro sets; Tatcha Longevity Serum sampling—positive, gift-forward.

- Repeat criticism clusters
  - Smashbox Original Photo Finish (slip on oily skin), Bobbi Brown Face Base (too heavy), L’Oréal Infallible setting spray (hairspray feel), Merit Great Skin primer (off-putting scent/texture), e.l.f. Power Grip (too tight/drying for dry skin), Kylie “King Kylie” aesthetic (dated).

## 3. Category Trends

- Eyeshadow palettes: Highest momentum. Multichrome/duochrome shimmers and blendable deep mattes are must-have; indie formulas are the comparison point.
- Highlighter: Blinding, “wet,” shift-heavy trios/palettes resurged (Astral Radiance). Layerability preferred over chunky sparkle.
- Blush: Layering liquid under powder (“blush cocktailing”) to sculpt/warm; terracotta/bronzed blush high-placement “warm sculpting.”
- Lips: Pigmented lip oils (including unconventional blue/berry) and vampy ombré lips (deep liners + central warm/brown/orange). Transfer-proof, comfortable mattes still relevant.
- Liners/accents: Metallic gel liners and multichrome flakes for waterline/accent strokes; gems/dots for editorial finish.
- Complexion/setting: Bifurcation—dewy grip tints and glowy sprays for dry; true oil-control primers/sprays and modern soft-matte foundations for oily/humid.

Seasonal shift: Spooky color stories (black/olive/chartreuse/red) paired with early holiday gifting and collector packaging; 70s autumnal neutrals as everyday bridge.

## 4. Emerging Themes & Narratives

- Celestial/cosmic launch wave: Cross-creator alignment praising Cosmic Beauty’s Starlight (palette, highlighters, liners, lip oils) with heavy affiliate/launch timing.
- Indie as default authority: Multiple reviewers positioning indie formulas (Adept, Blend Bunny, Singe, Gourmande Girls, Lethal, Fantasy Cosmetica) as performance benchmarks over legacy award picks.
- Texture maximalism: Multichrome/duochrome, glossy/shimmer toppers, metallic liners viewed as essential; swatches over tattoos as proof.
- Goth/Spooky aesthetics: Sustained demand for blacks, olives, cool purples, with chartreuse/lime accents; IP tie-ins and horror/fantasy themes retained pull.
- 70s nostalgia: Warm olives/rust/mustard (Singe Paisley Hoot) gaining visibility as versatile seasonal color story.
- Value and minis: Sephora/holiday sets and mini sizes celebrated for high-pigment categories; de-risking shade commitment and waste.
- Performance-first complexion: Oily-skin creators rejecting award winners; calling out true mattifiers and long-wear bases; dry-skin creators doubling down on grip + glow.

Regional/brand-origin signals:
- UK indie momentum: Cosmic Beauty’s drop (shipping/tariff-inclusive pricing called out) spiked demand across US audiences.
- Western indie core: Adept (US), Blend Bunny (US), Singe (creator-owned), Gourmande Girls (US), What’s Up Beauty (US) drove most purchase talk.
- Select K/J-beauty: Laneige seasonal lip mask and Tatcha serum featured positively but as secondary to indie color.

## 5. Purchase-Intent Signals

- Scarcity/launch specificity: “Oct 17, 1 pm EST” (Cosmic Beauty) and “Oct 18” (Adept RHNULL) with affiliate codes; initial bundle-only availability amplified urgency.
- Visual receipts: Multichrome/highlighter and matte depth proven via macro swatches and tattoo coverage; creators’ “wow” moments on special shades.
- Benchmarking: Blend Bunny mattes cited as gold standard; Adept shimmers “not dupes” vs. prior palettes—collector-safe to buy.
- Practical wins: Rare Beauty minis “enough pigment,” Too Faced tubing mascara as reliable repurchase; One/Size and Danessa sprays solving oily wear pain points.
- Themed collectibility: Lenticular/embossed packaging and cohesive stories (celestial, witchy, 70s) justified premium and gifting.
- Basket builders: Lip oils with novel tints, metallic liners, and glitter glue/“Thing-On” to unlock palette performance.

## 6. Opportunities for the Store

- Prioritize indie color with proof-first textures
  - Secure or waitlist: multichrome-forward palettes (e.g., Adept RHNULL equivalents), celestial-themed or goth-leaning palettes (Gourmande Girls Nevermore-type), and topper palettes (Blend Bunny Efflorescence-style).
  - Stock metallic gel liners and reliable glitter adhesives; these are frequent add-ons that enable the looks creators show.

- Build seasonal bundles
  - “Celestial Shift Kit”: multichrome palette + metallic liner + wet-look highlighter + glitter glue.
  - “Goth Glam Eye Stack”: black/olive matte palette + chartreuse/green shimmer single + gem accents.
  - “70s Autumn Neutrals”: warm olive/rust palette + muted rosy lip liner + matte liquid lipstick.

- Lean into blush layering
  - Offer curated duos: affordable liquid blush (terracotta/warm) + neutral powder blush to upsell “warm sculpting.” Include application guidance and placement visuals.

- Serve both complexion camps
  - Dry/dewy set: hydrating/gripping primers, skin tints/serum foundations, glowy mists.
  - Oily/long-wear set: true oil-control primers (One/Size-style), modern soft-matte foundations (ABH-style), mattifying but non-drying setting sprays (Danessa-style).

- Expand lip oils and vampy liners
  - Stock pigmented lip oils, including unconventional tints (blue, berry) and deep liners/blackened pencils to enable fall ombré looks; add a transfer-proof matte option for center-lip contrast.

- Merchandise by theme and proof
  - Use swatch-over-tattoo visuals and short reels to mirror creator content; highlight shift videos and “one-swipe” demos. Tag bundles with creator-style aesthetics (Celestial, Witchy, 70s).

- Value and minis
  - Curate mini sizes for high-pigment categories (blush, lip, liners) to match creator guidance on lower waste and easier trial; surface giftable sets early.

- Deprioritize/quality-screen
  - Skip stocking basic silicone “mattifying” primers that slip on oil, heavy “primer-moisturizers” positioned as primers, and underperforming “neither-glow-nor-set” powders; flag stick concealers that accentuate texture.

- Logistics and regional angle
  - If direct Cosmic Beauty stocking isn’t feasible, mimic demand with functionally similar SKUs (multichrome-heavy palettes; glossy, beaming highlighters) and message faster domestic shipping vs. UK tariffs/wait.

- Content to convert
  - Publish quick looks replicating creators’ hero combos: 
    - Chartreuse lid over black/olive base (Nevermore analogue).
    - Warm rust crease + teal multichrome pop (Starlight vibe).
    - Terracotta liquid + bronze powder blush stack.
  - Add “Compare vs. classic” posts (anti-dupe culture): show how your multichrome palette differs from prior bestsellers.

Overall: Stock the textures (multichrome shimmers, metallic liners, glossy/“wet” highlighters) and the supporting tools (adhesives, detail brushes) that make creator looks achievable, bundle by aesthetic, and segment complexion by climate/skin type to capture both dewy and long-wear shoppers.
