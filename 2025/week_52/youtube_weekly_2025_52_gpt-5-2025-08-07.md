# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key takeaway: For the week of 2025-12-22 to 2025-12-28, creators pushed “visible makeup” hard: blinding highlighters, vampy glossy lips, and cool-toned, multichrome-heavy eye looks dominated. Indie launches and holiday re-releases concentrated attention and purchase intent.

## 1. Overview

Creators leaned maximalist and product-forward. High-impact cheek light (glassy sticks, duochromes, baked powders) replaced “lit-from-within.” On eyes, cool-toned winter palettes (blue/silver/teal) and complex shimmers led the week across several indie drops and reissues.

There was heavy “combo” content: lip pairings (liner + glaze/oil) and blush layering (liquid + powder or glaze) to achieve intensity and longevity. These combos function as turnkey shopping lists and drive multi-item baskets.

Indie loyalty was clear. Gourmande Girls, Blend Bunny, Bella Beauté Bar, Oden’s Eye, Black Moon, and Fantasy Cosmetica earned repeated, highly positive coverage with affiliate codes attached, signaling strong conversion.

Value and texture discourse continued. Drugstore “dupes” (NYX, Hard Candy, Morphe) were praised when matching performance; heavy or tacky face products drew criticism, even at luxury levels. Reformulations (talc-free) and nostalgia relaunches sparked debate about payoff vs. memory.

Seasonally, creators embraced “gothic holiday” aesthetics—icy eyes with deep, glossy lips—and collector packaging. Urgency around limited re-releases and restocks amplified momentum.

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

- Top mentioned indie products with positive momentum
  - Blend Bunny: Haunt Me Eyeshadow Palette; Lip Glaze (Body Count); Lip Oil Gloss (Ghosted); Bloodline lip pencil. Strong praise for palette layout, matte quality, and the unusually pigmented dark gloss finish.
  - Gourmande Girls: Mostly Merry Palette. Multiple creators validated blendability and high-shine silver shimmer impact.
  - Bella Beauté Bar: Dark Dreamscape (named a 2025 favorite); Crystallize (called a “hit” for jeweled pastels + multichromes). Also highlighter singles featured positively in trend coverage.
  - Oden’s Eye: Silvery Bliss demo; Merry Christmas and Christmas Eve re-releases (new versions presented as upgraded with brighter, more complex shimmers).
  - Black Moon Cosmetics: New Lip Pencils (12 shades) received enthusiastic swatch approval, including niche shades (black, gray, deep purple).
  - Fantasy Cosmetica: The Artificer’s Familiar (collab) and Artificer palettes showed strong red-toned, multichrome performance.
  - Attitude Cosmetics: SUBMERGED palette launch spotlighted for saturated purples/greens and multichromes.

- Drugstore/value standouts (contextual anchors for indie positioning)
  - NYX Buttermelt Highlight (and Bronzer): consistent praise; “see-me” glow and good shade range.
  - Hard Candy Sweat On Lock Primer: strong “ONE/SIZE dupe” for oily/humid conditions.
  - Morphe Cloudlight powders: “Hourglass-like” finishing effect at lower price.

- Sentiment patterns
  - Highlighters: visible/glassy/duochrome formulas widely praised (NARS Light Reflecting Luminizing Powder; Dior Forever Glow Luminizer; Bella Beauté Bar, Unearthly, Lethal; Fenty lavender Diamond Bomb). Repeated negatives for heavy/tacky or base-lifting formulas (Urban Decay Face Bond, L’Oréal Le Glass white stick; Lancôme Teint Idole Highlighter; Prada Highlighter).
  - Palettes: Indie cool-toned and jewel-tone stories with special shimmers were universally positive. Reformulated Oden’s Eye viewed as an upgrade.
  - Lips: Dark/vampy glossy finishes and alternative shades (black/gray/purple) generated excitement. Blend Bunny’s Lip Glaze is applauded for even pigment but noted slippery for eating/drinking—signals demand for long-wear variants.

- Context/hype cycle
  - “Return of highlighters” is now mainstream dialogue. Indie brands lead color innovation; drugstore pushes accessibility.
  - Oden’s Eye holiday re-releases and Bella Beauté Bar’s high praise indicate mid-cycle strength (not just launch spike).
  - Black Moon’s liners fill a niche for goth-adjacent neutrals and true goth shades—early adoption likely to stick.

- Product combos creators pushed
  - Lips: Kaleidos liner + Blend Bunny Ghosted oil gloss; Blend Bunny Bloodline + Body Count Glaze; Kaleidos Double Espresso + Black Moon Werewolf.
  - Cheeks: Rare Beauty Liquid Blush (Truth/Wonder) + NYX “My Butta Half” powder; Rare Beauty Truth + Glossier Storm; Rare Beauty blush + Blend Bunny Celestial Cheek Glaze.
  - Base: Merit Complexion Stick + One/Size Base Thinner to shear and add dew.

## 3. Category Trends

- Highlighters: Clear resurgence—blinding, glassy, and colored/duochrome finishes. Nostalgic baked formats reappear, but reformulations must deliver impact to satisfy expectations.
- Eyeshadow: Cool-toned winter (teal/navy/silver) and jewel tones with multichrome shimmers. Indie palettes with curated quads and texture variety (smooth metallic + topper) stood out.
- Lips: Vampy glossy lacquer and oil-gloss hybrids; lip liner as full-lip color. Alternative shades (black/gray/deep purple) normalized in creator looks.
- Blush: Layering liquids under powders or glossy glazes to lock and intensify color; high, draped placement continues.
- Eyeliner/waterline: Brightening whites and colored pencils from indie and niche (Kaleidos) used repeatedly.
- Fatigue/skepticism: Tacky “glass” sticks that lift base; derivative complexion enhancers; overpriced singles.

## 4. Emerging Themes & Narratives

- Visible highlighter era (cross-creator): Multiple creators declare the highlighter comeback with emphasis on wetter textures, duochromes, and even glitter. Indie leads in color innovation; drugstore provides credible alternatives.
- Gothic/alt holiday aesthetic: Recurrent cool-toned smoky eyes, heavy silver lids, and vampy lips across Blend Bunny, Gourmande Girls, Oden’s Eye content.
- Combo culture = basket builders: “Lip combo” and “blush combo” are ubiquitous. Viewers are trained to buy pairs/sets to reproduce finishes.
- Indie brand leadership: Blend Bunny, Bella Beauté Bar, Oden’s Eye, Black Moon, Fantasy Cosmetica dominate positive sentiment and attention; affiliate ecosystems reinforce momentum.
- Reformulation narrative (EU/talc-free): Luxury/mainstream reformulations noted; consumers reward upgraded textures and punish heavy/dated formulas.
- Regional signals:
  - K-beauty: FWEE’s bouncy blush and customizable glosses gain strong praise—texture innovation resonating in Western markets.
  - European indie: Oden’s Eye (SE) and Lethal (DE) sustain visibility; perceived quality upgrades raise expectations for sparkle/multichrome standards in the EU sphere.
  - Western indie: US indie (Blend Bunny, Bella Beauté Bar, Black Moon, Fantasy Cosmetica) drives color, texture, and alternative shade adoption.

## 5. Purchase-Intent Signals

- Strong triggers
  - “Top fave of 2025” endorsement for Bella Beauté Bar Dark Dreamscape.
  - Multiple affiliate-coded demos/tutorials (Blend Bunny Haunt Me; Gourmande Girls Mostly Merry; Oden’s Eye re-releases; Attitude SUBMERGED).
  - Visual pigment proof via HD swatches and silent tutorials—low-friction persuasion.
  - Value-dupe framing: NYX Buttermelt vs Haus Labs; Hard Candy vs ONE/SIZE; Morphe Cloudlight vs Hourglass.
  - Seasonal scarcity and reissues (Oden’s Eye) driving urgency.

- Friction points to address
  - Slippery vampy glosses reduce wear-time confidence.

- Likely near-term demand
  - Multichrome-heavy, cool/jewel-toned palettes with both smooth metallics and topper textures.
  - Colored/duochrome highlighters (lavender, mint, green shifts) and baked or jelly-stick formats that don’t stay tacky.
  - Deep/dark lip liners and lacquers, plus goth-adjacent neutrals to broaden alt appeal.
  - Blush/glaze pairings and liquid-to-powder layering staples.

## 6. Opportunities for the Store

- What to stock now
  - High-impact highlighters:
    - Duochrome/colored options (purple, lavender, mint, green shifts) with transparent bases; non-tacky glassy sticks; high-shine baked formulas. Prioritize indie SKUs with proven sparkle and zero base-lift.
  - Cool-toned and jewel-toned palettes:
    - Curations with mattes + mixed-shimmer systems (smooth metallics and toppers/multichromes). If possible, secure indie launches like SUBMERGED-style assortments or Oden’s Eye–like cool stories.
  - Vampy lip ecosystem:
    - Deep liners (brown, oxblood, plum, black/gray) and pigmented glazes/oils. Add a long-wear dark lacquer/gloss option to fill the “slippery” gap flagged by creators.
  - Blush layering kits:
    - Pair liquid blush stains with set-and-amplify powders or cheek glazes. Sell as bundles mirroring creator combos (e.g., cool berry liquid + berry-mauve powder + glaze topper).

- Merchandising tactics
  - Bundle for “combo culture”:
    - Lip Combo Kits (liner + glaze/oil + remover wipe).
    - Blush Layering Duos/Trios (liquid + powder + glaze/highlighter).
    - “Silver Ice Eye” sets (cool-toned palette + liquid shadow base + white waterline pencil).
  - “Visible Highlighter” shop-in-shop:
    - Curate by finish (glassy, baked, duochrome, glitter) with no-tack, no-lift guarantees in PDP copy.
  - Add a “Base Mixers & Enhancers” micro-category:
    - Stock a compatible mixing/thinning medium and shimmer enhancers (eye bases) to support customization hacks.

- Where demand is rising
  - Black/dark gray lip liners and goth neutrals (Black Moon–style).
  - Lavender/pink highlighters and colored cheek lights.
  - Cool-toned blues/silvers/teals in winter stories; upgraded sparkle standards.

- Avoid/limit
  - Tacky highlighter balms that lift base or never set.
  - Sheer luminizers marketed as highlighters with poor payoff.
  - Overpriced singles without palette value-story (singles need either rare shades or standout textures to justify).

- Gaps to fill (product development or sourcing)
  - Transfer-resistant, high-pigment vampy gloss/lacquer with comfortable wear.
  - Talc-free, high-sparkle pressed highlighters that remain lightweight and non-sticky.
  - Inclusive cool-toned face accessories: white/icy toppers and true navy/teal mattes in small curated quads.

Overall: Lean into visible sparkle and alt lip depth; package techniques into bundles; enforce texture standards (no tack, no lift) in selection. Indie customers are primed to buy sets that deliver exact creator outcomes.
