# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key takeaway (Dec 22–28, 2025): Indie color launches and reissues drove end-of-year buzz while creators leaned into glossy lips, glazed cheeks, cool-toned sparkle, and a clear “highlighters are back” narrative. Affiliate-led micro-demos and bundleable product combos dominated content and purchase intent.

## 1. Overview

Creators favored quick, silent micro-tutorials and reels pushing specific product pairings (lip liner + oil/glaze; blush + glaze; palette + blue liner). The vibe was decisively winter: icy blues, silvers, teals, and jewel tones on eyes; nude or vampy glossy lips to balance.

Highlighter talk accelerated. Multiple creators framed 2025 as a comeback year for highlight across textures (powder, liquid, jelly), with nostalgic revivals (Laura Geller) and new drugstore standouts (NYX Buttermelt) fueling the glow discourse.

Value and dupe framing cropped up via drugstore “luxury feel” picks (Hard Candy primer vs ONE/SIZE; Morphe Cloudlight vs Hourglass), while Western indie palettes provided the artistry and multichrome payoffs audiences expect during holiday looks.

Reissues and restocks signaled durable demand: Oden’s Eye resurrected its Christmas palettes, and creators compared old vs new. Bella Beauté Bar earned year-end “favorite” status, pushing jewel-tone multichrome desirability into early 2026.

Affiliate codes were pervasive, and “lip combo” and “blush combo” formats encouraged multi-item carts. Default staples emerged (Kaleidos eyeliners/lip pencils) as creators’ go-to anchors for bold or icy looks.

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

- Top mentioned indie products
  - Gourmande Girls Mostly Merry palette: Multi-creator usage (Angelica, Heather) with strong visual proof of blendable mattes and high-impact silver shimmer. Seasonal snow-globe packaging and cool-toned story resonated.
  - Blend Bunny Haunt Collection (lip oils/glazes) + liners: Cross-creator adoption (battybean, Rachel, Angelica used Haunt palette/lips). “Ghosted” Lip Oil Gloss and “Body Count” Lip Glaze repeatedly shown in combos; “Bloodline” liner anchored deep vamp looks.
  - Bella Beauté Bar Dark Dreamscape (and Crystallize mention): Declared a 2025 favorite by Angelica; extensive swatch proof of saturated mattes and complex shimmers; packaging/art elevated collectibility.
  - Oden’s Eye (Silvery Bliss content; Merry Christmas/Christmas Eve re-release): Visibility spike via multiple posts; cool-toned/icy positioning; direct reissue hype sustained interest.
  - Dede Signature Fearless Holiday palette + Cookie primer: High-pigment reds/greens/teals for bold festive looks; Cookie primer repeatedly used in GRWMs.
  - Arttitude (Submerged): Multichrome/holochrome story surfaced via Heather; aligns with the week’s reflective/icy aesthetic.
  - Fantasy Cosmetica (The Witch’s Familiar; Artificer pairing): Creator-collab tie-ins maintained interest post-launch.

- Sentiment trends
  - Predominantly positive for indie palettes (pigmentation, blendability, shimmer complexity) and for lip oils/glazes (comfort, shine).
  - Highlighters: broad positivity; “throwback” love (BPerfect Skin Sheen; Laura Geller Gilded Honey) plus excitement for newer textures and drugstore standouts (NYX Buttermelt).
  - Value/dupe conversation drove favorable sentiment for Hard Candy primer, Morphe Cloudlight powders.

- Context and hype position
  - Holiday-limited and reissue urgency drove Oden’s Eye and seasonal palettes.
  - Bella Beauté Bar is transitioning from niche buzz to year-end “best-of” anchor—expect durable demand.
  - Blend Bunny lips are moving from launch novelty to “default combo” territory through repeated creator use.

- Notable clusters
  - “Lots of creators testing”: Gourmande Girls Mostly Merry; Blend Bunny Haunt lips; Oden’s Eye holiday reissues.
  - “Default comparison point”: Morphe Cloudlight as Hourglass Ambient dupe; Hard Candy as ONE/SIZE-adjacent primer for oily skin.
  - Repeat criticism: Not materially present this week; one “Worst of 2025” format existed but without cross-creator alignment.

- Product combos creators tested
  - Lips: Kaleidos liner + Blend Bunny Ghosted; Blend Bunny Bloodline liner + Body Count glaze; neutral nudes and deep vamp pairings.
  - Cheeks: Rare Beauty blush layered with Blend Bunny Celestial Cheek Glaze; Rare Beauty + NYX; Rare Beauty + Glossier for depth + glaze.
  - Base: Merit foundation stick + ONE/SIZE Base Thinner to tailor texture/coverage.
  - Eyes: Deep blue/teal mattes blended with mint transitions; heavy silver shimmer toppers; blue liners (Kaleidos) to intensify icy looks.

## 3. Category Trends

- Lips: High-shine lip oils/glazes and hydrating stains led. Two-tone strategies (liner base + glossy topper) are the norm. Shades oscillated between balanced nudes and rich burgundies.
- Highlighter: Clear revival across formats—intense, reflective finishes are back. Throwbacks gained traction alongside new drugstore/luxe options.
- Eyeshadow: Cool-toned winter stories (blue, teal, silver) and jewel-tone multichromes dominated; graphic liner supported bolder holiday glam.
- Complexion: Oily-skin control and “filter finish” blurring were celebrated (mattifying primers, soft-glow finishing powders); mix-ins to thin base products re-emerged.
- Brows/freckles: Tinted pens and faux freckle tools mentioned as ongoing micro-trends.

Seasonal shift signals: Demand tilted toward icy palettes, silver toppers, mint transition mattes, and reflective textures suitable for New Year looks.

## 4. Emerging Themes & Narratives

- Highlighters are back (cross-creator): Dedicated roundup (42 releases), throwback revivals (Laura Geller), drugstore intensity (NYX Buttermelt), and weekly shorts praising highlight finishes.

- Affiliate-driven micro-demos: Short, music-backed, code-heavy posts created low-friction paths to purchase with “copy-this-combo” framing.
- Reissues/restocks as strategy: Oden’s Eye holiday palettes returned; creators contrasted old vs new; audiences rewarded nostalgia.
- Regional signals and brand-origin momentum:
  - K-beauty: FWEE’s bouncy blush and tunable-pigment glosses earned “obsessed” labels—K-beauty textures remain sticky at drugstore price points.

## 6. Opportunities for the Store

- What to stock/feature now
  - Lip oils/glazes + liners: Prioritize Blend Bunny (Ghosted, Body Count, Bloodline) and offer pre-built “combo” bundles (deep vamp and neutral nude options). If Blend Bunny is not accessible, curate indie equivalents with high-shine, non-sticky finishes.
  - Cool-toned, reflective palettes: Secure Gourmande Girls Mostly Merry, Bella Beauté Bar (Dark Dreamscape; upcoming Crystallize), Arttitude Submerged, Nomad Polar Express, and Oden’s Eye reissues if your sourcing allows. Spotlight jewel tones + silver toppers; include blue liners in kits.
  - Highlighters across textures: Add or restock indie highlight ranges (e.g., Bella Beauté Bar, Unearthly, Lethal, Gourmande Girls) plus “jelly”/stick textures. Merchandise a “Highlighter Comeback” edit with clear texture navigation.
  - Oily-skin solutions and finish-tuners: Mattifying primers and base thinners alongside soft-glow finishing powders that don’t emphasize oil—bundle as “humid-climate kits.”
  - K-beauty textures: If you carry K-beauty, add FWEE Blurry Pudding Pots and 3D Voluming Glosses; emphasize tunable pigment (30%/70%) and bouncy textures.

- Merchandising plays
  - Bundle the looks creators showed:
    - Icy Eye Kit: cool-toned palette + silver/shimmer single + blue liner.
    - Glazed Cheek Duo: cream/soft-matte blush + cheek glaze/topper.
    - Vamp Lip Kit: deep liner + pigmented glaze.
  - “Mint Matters”: highlight mint/light seafoam mattes as ideal transition shades for deep teals/blues.

- Content/partnerships
  - Lean into short-form, code-driven creator partnerships that demo exact combos. Provide ready-to-cart bundles matching creators’ shade names.
  - Use reissue/nostalgia hooks (Oden’s Eye-style) to promote your archive or similar color stories.

- Cautions
  - Warm-neutral holiday palettes had minimal spotlight; allocate shelf space to cool-toned/jewel-tone stories instead.
  - Be selective with mainstream-branded color items that showed up in “worst of” content; prioritize indie performers that earned cross-creator praise.

Overall: Stock for glossy lips, glazed cheeks, reflective highlighters, and cool-toned multichrome palettes. Package them as creator-inspired kits, ride the reissue wave, and spotlight oily-skin-friendly finishes to convert value-focused shoppers.
