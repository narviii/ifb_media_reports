# Weekly Instagram Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key Takeaway: 2025-12-22 to 2025-12-28 was a cool-toned, sparkle-heavy week blending festive and goth—blue glow highlighters, multichrome toppers, and graphic liners led the visual story—while restock chatter centered on sold-out indie palettes and new lip launches drove purchase intent.

## 1. Overview

- The Vibe:
  - Tutorial-first reels dominated (step-by-steps, swatches, travel “capsule” curation, affordable sparkle roundups).
  - Heavy sparkle textures (multichrome, holo, glitter gel), icy eye looks, and pop-culture tie-ins (Ghibli, Rocky Horror, Edward Scissorhands).
  - Lips were a headline: black gloss/liner kits, cool taupe-brown mattes, and “galaxy” lip combos (stain + sparkly balm).

- Engagement Temperature:
  - High excitement: “I need it,” “saving to get the set,” “can’t wait for mine to arrive,” shade-specific questions.
  - Clear demand signals around sold-out or returning palettes (Bella Beauté Bar, Glaminatrix, Oden’s Eye).

  - Availability windows (ColourPop Winx stix; TIRTIR global release).

## 5. Opportunities for the Store

- Stocking Recommendations:
  - Cool-toned, winter palettes with gray-leaning pastels and high-impact toppers (BBB-style; Glaminatrix singles including the blue highlighter shade).
  - Multichrome/duochrome sticks and singles: green-brown and blue-brown families (Clionadh, Terra Moons, ColourPop, Beauty Creations, Moira, Catrice).
  - Black lip wardrobe: black liner, sheer-black gloss, and deep cool browns/taupes (Glisten’s kit vibe; Cosmic Beauty’s Mink, 90s).
  - Sparkly balm toppers (Hyrular Nebubalms) and lip melts (Kaleidos).
  - Colored mascaras beyond black (burgundy, white, pink); red and metallic eyeliners.
  - Cushion blushes and accessories (TIRTIR; ensure quality puffs) plus velvet-matte stick blushes (Banila Co).
  - Blue-toned highlighters (Rituel de Fille, Kaleidos, Dieverune, budget options).

- Content Strategy:
  - Comparison and “nerd out” swatch reels (duochrome families) drive saves/shares.
  - Short tutorials with full product lists and combo reveals (liner shade + lip combo) fuel comments.
  - Restock alerts and “new vs old” breakdowns (Oden’s Eye, returning classics like Gilded Honey).
  - Lip-focused shorts (black gloss try-ons, cool nude lineups) perform reliably.
  - Skincare utility explainers tied to makeup outcomes (retinol eye creams for concealer glide; cushion puff technique) pull high views.

- Gap Analysis:
  - Crease-proofing for high-shine shimmers: bundle glitter adhesive/primers and recommend techniques.
  - Black lip gloss scarcity: curate a small but distinct assortment (sheer black, black with sparkle, balm-gloss hybrids).
  - Eye gloss for hooded lids: offer alternatives (eye-safe balms/toppers that set) and transparent communication.
  - Price sensitivity/clarity on reissues: provide clear spec sheets (pan size, formula tweaks) for re-launched palettes.

## 6. Special insights

- Emerging Micro-Trends:
  - Blue glow halo: blue highlighters as cheek/inner-corner/brow-bone accents across creators; UV vibes on deeper skin noted as especially striking.
  - Colored mascara revival (white, burgundy, pink) paired with graphic liner for dimension without heavy falsies.
  - “Galaxy lips” layering: dark stains/liners under sheer, high-shine sparkly balms.

- Unexpected Pairings:
  - Deep teal lipstick anchored with neon lime eyes and black graphic wing (fragrance-inspired look).
  - Eyeshadows repurposed as highlighters (Glaminatrix blue), and CHANEL lavender blush used as under-eye brightening powder.
  - Holographic toppers over gray mattes for sophisticated party looks (custom travel palettes).

- Creative insight:
  - Lean into “capsule sparkle” curation: a 6–8 pan custom kit (gray mattes, one black, three multichrome toppers, one blue highlighter, one metallic liner, one colored mascara). Sell as a winter-edit bundle with a “how to wear” reel series.
  - Host a “black lip lab” live: line/texture mixing clinic using black liner + sheer balms + cool nudes to demystify depth on different undertones.
  - Run “duochrome families” guides (blue-brown vs green-brown vs red-gold) with side-by-side daylight vs lowlight clips to reduce returns and boost confidence.
