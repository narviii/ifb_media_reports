# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

For the week ending December 28, 2025, the YouTube beauty landscape was dominated by a definitive shift toward high-impact, visible makeup, driven by indie brands launching thematic winter and gothic-inspired collections. This trend was most pronounced in the eyeshadow and highlighter categories, where complex formulas and bold color stories captured creator attention, while select drugstore products gained significant traction for delivering luxury-level performance.

## 1. Overview

The final week of the year felt like a referendum on innovation versus repetition. Excitement was palpable for indie brands pushing unique, often darker, holiday aesthetics. Collections like Blend Bunny's *Haunt Me* and the cool-toned palettes from Gourmande Girls and Bella Beauté Bar signaled a strong market for non-traditional, "gothic holiday" looks, moving beyond classic red and gold. This stood in stark contrast to the fatigue expressed toward some mainstream releases, which were criticized as derivative and overpriced.

A central narrative was the "return of the highlighter," framed not as a revival of subtle glows but as a full-force embrace of blinding, glassy, and colorful finishes. Angelica Nyqvist's comprehensive roundup of 42 highlighters confirmed the category's saturation, while the lukewarm reception to the reformulated Laura Geller *Gilded Honey* served as a key lesson: consumers seeking nostalgia demand the same high-impact performance of the original, not a muted "grown-up" version.

Across the board, value was a critical theme. Creators championed high-performing drugstore products, with the NYX Buttermelt line and Morphe's Cloudlight powders repeatedly positioned as direct dupes for luxury counterparts. This, combined with the rise of K-beauty textures from brands like FWEE, underscores a market where performance and novelty, not just brand prestige, dictate creator validation.

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

-   **Blend Bunny Cosmetics:** The *Haunt Me* collection saw significant, positive coverage. The eyeshadow palette was praised for its unique gothic theme and versatile layout. The *Body Count* Lip Glaze was a standout for its intense pigmentation in a glossy, non-streaky formula, frequently paired with the *Bloodline* pencil in "vampy lip combo" tutorials.

-   **Bella Beauté Bar:** This brand has powerful momentum. The *Dark Dreamscape* palette was named a "fave of 2025" by Angelica Nyqvist, a major endorsement. The new *Crystallize* palette was also lauded as a "hit" for its jewel-toned pastel color story and high-impact multichrome shimmers. Sentiment is exceptionally positive, driven by formula complexity.

-   **Gourmande Girls:** The *Mostly Merry* palette was featured positively by multiple creators, solidifying its status as a successful winter-themed release. Its cool-toned, icy color story and high-shine shimmers were consistently highlighted. The brand's upcoming restocks of popular palettes were also noted, signaling sustained demand.

-   **Oden's Eye:** The re-release of the *Merry Christmas* and *Christmas Eve* palettes generated significant discussion. Swatch comparisons confirmed the new versions feature visibly superior, more complex multichrome and shimmer formulas. While this was largely seen as a positive upgrade, some purists noted changes to the original formulas and shade selection, creating a slightly mixed but overall positive sentiment.

-   **NYX:** The Buttermelt Bronzers and Highlighters were the drugstore standouts of the week. The bronzers were described as "flawless" and skin-like, while the highlighters were praised for their intense, colorful payoff, aligning perfectly with the visible highlighter trend.

-   **Rare Beauty:** The Soft Pinch Liquid Blush continues its market dominance, appearing repeatedly as the base layer in "blush combo" videos. It is the default product for achieving high saturation and longevity, frequently paired with powder blushes from NYX or Glossier to intensify the look.

-   **Product Combos:** A recurring content format involved specific product pairings.
    -   **Blush:** Rare Beauty Liquid Blush + a powder blush (NYX, Glossier).
    -   **Lips:** Blend Bunny *Bloodline Pencil* + *Body Count Glaze*; Kaleidos *Double Espresso Pencil* + Black Moon *Werewolf Lipstick*.
    -   **Foundation:** Merit Complexion Stick + One/Size Base Thinner for a sheer, dewy finish.

## 3. Category Trends

-   **Highlighters:** This category is back with a focus on high-impact finishes. The demand is for glassy, wet-look, duochrome, and colorful (lavender, green, pink) formulas. The subtle "lit-from-within" aesthetic has been displaced by a desire for visible, often blinding, glow. Indie brands are seen as leaders in this space.

-   **Eyeshadow:** Momentum is concentrated in indie brands offering complex, thematic palettes. The prevailing aesthetics are cool-toned, jewel-toned, and moody/gothic. Multi-chrome, duochrome, and intensely sparkling finishes are the primary drivers of purchase intent.

-   **Blush:** The dominant technique is layering a liquid or cream formula underneath a powder. This "blush combo" trend is used to achieve maximum color saturation and long wear. High placement on the cheekbones for a "lifted" look remains standard.

-   **Complexion:** A "foundation hacking" trend is visible, with creators mixing products (e.g., stick foundation + thinner) to customize coverage and achieve a sheer, dewy finish. This signals a desire for versatile base products that can be adapted to different looks.

## 4. Emerging Themes & Narratives

-   **The "Gothic Holiday" Aesthetic:** Multiple creators embraced a darker, moodier aesthetic for the holiday season, moving beyond traditional festive colors. Blend Bunny's *Haunt Me* collection is the prime example, but the cool-toned, jewel-like palettes from Oden's Eye and Gourmande Girls also fit this narrative. This signals an appetite for alternative seasonal themes.

-   **Indie Brands as Market Leaders:** A clear consensus emerged that indie brands are driving innovation in color, texture, and theme. They are consistently praised for unique formulas (multichromes) and cohesive collections, while several mainstream launches were dismissed as uninspired or overpriced.

-   **K-Beauty Formula Innovation:** The inclusion of K-beauty brand FWEE in a "Best of Drugstore" roundup is a significant signal. Specific praise for its unique "blurry pudding" blush texture and customizable gloss pigmentation suggests growing creator interest in novel K-beauty formulas entering the Western market.

-   **Luxury Performance at Drugstore Prices:** The narrative of affordable products "duping" high-end counterparts is strong. The NYX Buttermelt line and Morphe's Cloudlight powders (compared to Hourglass) were lauded for their exceptional quality-to-price ratio, putting pressure on prestige brands to justify their cost.

## 5. Purchase-Intent Signals

-   **Heavy Affiliate Code Promotion:** Nearly every feature of an indie brand (Blend Bunny, Bella Beauté Bar, Gourmande Girls, Oden's Eye) was accompanied by a creator's affiliate code, indicating a coordinated and strong commercial push.
-   **"Best of 2025" Designations:** Endorsements like "fave palette of 2025" for Bella Beauté Bar's *Dark Dreamscape* or inclusion in a "10 Best Drugstore" list serve as powerful, high-trust recommendations that directly drive sales.
-   **"Combo" Framing:** Presenting products as a necessary pairing (e.g., "lip combo," "blush combo") effectively encourages the purchase of multiple items to replicate a specific, desirable look.
-   **Visual Proof of Upgraded Formulas:** The side-by-side swatch comparisons of the old vs. new Oden's Eye palettes provided clear, compelling visual evidence of superior quality, creating a strong incentive for both new buyers and existing owners to purchase the reformulated versions.

## 6. Opportunities for the Store

-   **Stock High-Momentum Indie Palettes:** Prioritize palettes from **Blend Bunny**, **Bella Beauté Bar**, and **Gourmande Girls**. These brands have strong, cross-creator validation and align with the current demand for complex shimmers and unique color stories.
-   **Curate for the "Visible Highlighter" Trend:** Focus sourcing on high-impact highlighters with duochrome, colorful, or glassy finishes. The **NYX Buttermelt Highlighters** are a validated, accessible option. Highlighters from indie brands known for special effects (like Bella Beauté Bar) would also perform well.
-   **Market "Creator-Approved Combos":** Create bundled offerings based on the layering trends. A "Max-Pigment Blush Duo" (liquid + powder) or a "Vampy Lip Kit" (deep liner + high-shine gloss) would resonate well and increase average order value.
-   **Embrace Alternative Aesthetics:** The "Gothic Holiday" and general moody makeup trends present a clear market gap. Stocking palettes with cool-toned jewel and grunge color stories, alongside unconventional lip colors like the **Black Moon Cosmetics Lip Pencils** (black, gray, deep browns), will attract this engaged customer segment.
-   **Explore Innovative K-Beauty:** The positive reception to **FWEE** suggests an opportunity to differentiate by stocking K-beauty brands known for novel textures (pudding, jelly, bouncy formulas) in color cosmetics, not just skincare.
