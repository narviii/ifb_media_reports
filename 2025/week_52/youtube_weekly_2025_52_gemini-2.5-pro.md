# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

- For the week of December 22–28, 2025, indie brands dominated the pre-holiday and post-Christmas conversation, driven by highly commercial, affiliate-coded content focused on seasonal palettes and high-shine product combinations.

## 1. Overview

The week's atmosphere was intensely focused on indie brands, functioning as a final holiday sales push. Creators like Angelica Nyqvist, battybean, and Heather Austin heavily leveraged their affiliate partnerships, with discount codes frequently appearing directly in video titles. The narrative was less about critical reviews and more about enthusiastic showcases and tutorials.

Content centered on seasonal eyeshadow palettes, but with a distinct preference for alternative and cool-toned color stories (icy blues, deep greens, purples) over traditional festive reds and golds. This signals a move toward a "wintery" aesthetic rather than a strictly "Christmas" one.

A notable content trend was the "product combo" format, particularly from creator battybean. These short-form videos demonstrated layering specific products—a blush base with a glaze topper, or a lip liner with a gloss—to achieve a unique, high-impact finish. This format implicitly encourages purchasing multiple items to replicate a curated look.

Finally, a strong value narrative emerged, with creators highlighting affordable drugstore products that deliver luxury-level performance. This indicates a persistent consumer interest in high-quality formulas without the prestige price point, especially within complexion categories.

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

-   **Gourmande Girls Mostly Merry Palette:** This was a top-mentioned product, featured in tutorials by both Angelica Nyqvist and Heather Austin. Sentiment was uniformly positive, with demonstrations highlighting the blendability of its cool-toned mattes and the high impact of its silver shimmers. It is clearly positioned as a go-to for a winter/icy aesthetic.

-   **Blend Bunny Cosmetics:** The brand saw significant visibility across multiple product categories, consistently promoted with affiliate codes.
    -   **Lip Products (Ghosted Lip Oil Gloss, Body Count Lip Glaze, Bloodline Pencil):** Featured in "lip combo" videos, demonstrating their ability to create a high-shine, vampy, or glossy neutral lip. The performance appears reliable and the aesthetic is popular.
    -   **Cheek Products (Celestial Cheek Glaze):** Used as a topper in a "blush combo" video, showcasing the trend of layering textures for a dimensional, "glazed" finish.

-   **Bella Beauté Bar Dark Dreamscape Palette:** Received the strongest single endorsement of the week from Angelica Nyqvist, who named it "one of my fave palettes of 2025." The high praise, combined with compelling visual swatches of its jewel-toned shades, generated significant positive momentum.

-   **FWEE (K-Beauty):** This brand was a standout in Heather Austin's "Best of Drugstore" video.
    -   **Blurry Pudding Pot & 3D Voluming Gloss:** Praised for unique bouncy/pudding textures, comfortable formulas, and thoughtful packaging. The creator's "obsession" and personal purchasing of multiple shades signals strong user satisfaction and rising interest in innovative K-Beauty formulas.

-   **Drugstore "Luxury Dupes":**
    -   **Morphe Cloudlight Soft Glow Veil Powders:** Explicitly compared to Hourglass Ambient Lighting Powders, gaining credibility as a high-value alternative for a luminous, skin-filtering effect.
    -   **Hard Candy Sweat On Lock Primer:** Positioned as a strong performer for oily skin and a viable alternative to the pricier ONE/SIZE Oil Sucker Primer.

-   **Product Combo Clusters:** The most consistent combination pattern came from battybean, who repeatedly paired a base color product (Rare Beauty Blush, Kaleidos Lip Pencil) with a high-shine indie topper (Blend Bunny Cheek Glaze, Blend Bunny Lip Oil).

## 3. Category Trends

-   **Eyeshadow Palettes:** This category remains dominant, but the focus is on indie brands with distinct, non-traditional color stories. The demand is for cool-toned winter themes (blues, silvers, deep greens) and rich jewel tones (purples, teals).

-   **Lips:** High-shine finishes are the clear trend. Lip oils, glazes, and glossy stains showed momentum. The "lip combo"—using a pencil for definition and a gloss for texture and shine—is a recurring application technique.

-   **Cheeks:** Blush layering is an emerging micro-trend. Creators are combining different formulas (e.g., a liquid or cream base with a luminous powder or "glaze" topper) to create more complex, dimensional cheek looks. The "glazed" cheek is gaining traction.

-   **Seasonal Shift:** The aesthetic has fully shifted to a winter theme. Icy shimmers, cool blues, and deep, moody colors are prevalent, suggesting a move away from the warm, cozy tones of autumn.

## 4. Emerging Themes & Narratives

-   **The "Creator Combo" as a Sales Tactic:** The repeated "lip combo" and "blush combo" framing is a powerful narrative. It presents a curated, guaranteed result and encourages the purchase of two or more specific products to achieve it. This appears to be an effective, creator-driven merchandising strategy.

-   **K-Beauty's Textural Innovation:** The enthusiastic reception of FWEE's "pudding" and "bouncy" textures highlights a key market differentiator for K-Beauty. Consumers are drawn to novel formulas that promise a unique sensorial experience and excellent performance, reinforcing K-Beauty's momentum as a source of innovation.

-   **Alternative Holiday Glam:** Across multiple videos, the definition of "holiday makeup" was expanded beyond classic red lips and gold glitter. Deep burgundy lips, dramatic teal and blue smoky eyes, and graphic liner were presented as festive looks, catering to an audience with a more alternative or artistic aesthetic.

-   **Affiliate Marketing as Primary Endorsement:** The line between review and promotion is increasingly blurred. The prominent use of affiliate codes in titles suggests that content is created with direct conversion in mind. For indie brands, this creator-led marketing is their primary channel for visibility and sales.

## 5. Purchase-Intent Signals

-   **Explicit High Praise:** Angelica Nyqvist calling the Bella Beauté Bar palette a "fave of 2025" is a powerful signal that drives immediate interest and trust.
-   **"Luxury Dupe" Framing:** Heather Austin's direct comparisons of drugstore items to high-end cult favorites (Morphe vs. Hourglass) is a strong trigger for value-oriented shoppers.
-   **Repeat Personal Purchases:** Mentioning the purchase of multiple shades of a product (e.g., FWEE glosses) is a credible indicator of genuine satisfaction and encourages audience buys.
-   **Affiliate Code Saturation:** The placement of discount codes directly in video titles is a clear call-to-action, designed to convert viewers into customers immediately.
-   **Visual Proof:** High-quality swatches and clear demonstrations of products performing as advertised (e.g., intense shimmer, smooth blending) are consistently used to validate quality and generate desire.

## 6. Opportunities for the Store

-   **Stock These Categories:** Focus on indie eyeshadow palettes with cool-toned or jewel-toned color stories. High-shine lip products (oils, glazes) are essential. Consider adding innovative cheek toppers ("glazes") to capitalize on the blush layering trend.

-   **Featured Brands to Consider:**
    -   **Gourmande Girls & Bella Beauté Bar:** Both show strong, positive momentum and creator backing in the eyeshadow category.
    -   **Blend Bunny:** A key player in the high-shine lip and cheek space. Stocking their liners, glosses, and cheek products is recommended.
    -   **FWEE:** The strong signal around this brand suggests an opportunity to source it or similar innovative K-Beauty brands known for unique textures and formulas.

-   **Merchandising Strategy:**
    -   Market products in pairs as "Creator-Approved Combos" (e.g., a lip liner and gloss set, a cream blush and highlighter duo). This aligns with current content trends and simplifies the customer journey.
    -   Highlight affordable, high-performance alternatives to luxury staples, particularly in complexion categories like finishing powders and primers.

-   **Identified Gaps:** While not a gap, the strong positive sentiment for high-performing, affordable complexion products (Morphe powders, NYX bronzers) suggests a consistent demand that an indie retailer can meet by curating a selection of high-value base products alongside more artistic color cosmetics.
