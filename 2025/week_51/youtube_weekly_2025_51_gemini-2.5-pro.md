# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

- In the week ending December 21, 2025, creator focus shifted from new discovery to definitive year-end rankings, overwhelmingly solidifying the market dominance of indie brands in eyeshadow and cheek categories while highlighting a growing demand for alternative, moody winter aesthetics.

## 1. Overview

The week was dominated by retrospective analysis as creators published their "Best of 2025" rankings and comprehensive palette reviews. This was not a week of hype for the unknown, but a confident declaration of the year's winners, driven by long-term performance over initial launch excitement. The mood was analytical and discerning, with creators like Angelica Nyqvist even using spreadsheets to quantify brand release fatigue.

A clear narrative of "indie supremacy" emerged, with brands like Blend Bunny, Bella Beaute Bar, and Unearthly Cosmetics consistently topping lists, praised for superior formulas and creative vision. Mainstream brands were often criticized for uninspired color stories (Sigma) or poor quality control (Morphe, Glamlite).

The holiday theme was present but interpreted through an alternative lens. Creators gravitated towards gothic, moody, and jewel-toned color stories—deep greens, blues, purples, and rich berries—rather than traditional festive reds and golds. This was reinforced by strong positive sentiment for collections like Blend Bunny's "Haunt Me."

Complexion conversations highlighted a value-driven pragmatism. An expensive luxury foundation (Victoria Beckham) was noted as a failure for oily skin, while a more accessible skin tint (Make Up For Ever) was crowned a product of the year, signaling that performance and finish trump brand prestige for daily wear.

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

-   **Blend Bunny Cosmetics Haunt Me Palette**: The most significant new release of the week, featured in multiple tutorials and swatching videos. Sentiment is universally positive, with creators praising its "dark, grungy dream" aesthetic, high-quality mattes, and cohesive cool-toned color story. It is already a staple for alternative holiday looks.

-   **Oden's Eye Holiday Palettes (Re-release)**: Generated significant buzz due to the re-release of "OG" fan-favorites. Visuals from multiple creators confirm the high-impact, multi-dimensional shimmer formula the brand is known for. The decision to offer them as singles was seen as a smart response to consumer demand.

-   **Lethal Cosmetics Serpentine Palette**: Received multiple positive mentions for its "amazing" formula and unique color story combining greens and berry tones. It was featured in multi-palette looks and dedicated tutorials, indicating strong creator interest.

-   **Unearthly Cosmetics Incandescent Blushes**: Praised by multiple creators in their "Best of 2025" lists for its reformulated satin finish. The consensus is that the new formula provides a "youthful glow" without being metallic, a significant improvement over the previous version.

-   **Victoria Beckham Beauty**: Received a detailed, mixed-sentiment breakdown. The color products—**Matte Bronzing Brick**, **Reflect Highlighter Stick**, and **Satin Kajal Liners**—were lauded as "top favorites" with luxurious, high-performance formulas. However, the **Foundation Drops** were a clear miss for oily skin, failing a wear test and demonstrating poor shade matching for olive undertones.

-   **Product Combos**: A key trend was layering products for unique finishes. The most notable combination was **Rare Beauty Hope Bouncy Blush** (as a cream base) topped with a metallic shade from the **Blend Bunny Pro Luster Palette** for a high-shine, dimensional cheek. Indie lip combos were also popular, such as **Unearthly Cosmetics Cafe Pencil** with **Kaleidos Cypher Lip Melt**.

## 3. Category Trends

-   **Eyeshadow Palettes**: This category dominated the conversation, driven by year-end rankings. The prevailing aesthetic was moody and complex. Creators favored jewel tones, muted purples, deep greens, and icy shimmers over traditional neutrals or brights. Palettes from Blend Bunny, Bella Beaute Bar, Dede Signature, and Nomad Cosmetics were consistently highlighted as exemplifying this trend.

-   **Blush**: Continued momentum with a focus on finish and application. Satin and "luminous matte" finishes were preferred over flat mattes or glittery formulas. Layering a cream or liquid blush under a powder blush was a frequently demonstrated technique to enhance dimension and longevity. The "rosy-brown" shade family was explicitly identified as a key color trend.

-   **Complexion**: A preference for lightweight, hydrating, skin-like finishes continues. Skin tints (Make Up For Ever, Fenty Eaze Drop) and gel tints (Milk Makeup) were named as yearly favorites, valued for providing coverage without feeling heavy. There is clear skepticism toward high-priced foundations that don't deliver on wear time for non-dry skin types.

-   **Lips**: While comfortable lip oils and glossy balms remain daily staples, there was renewed interest in specific indie liquid lipsticks (Menagerie, Likely Makeup) and cream formulas (Unearthly) in deep berry, burgundy, and brown-red shades for the winter season.

## 4. Emerging Themes & Narratives

-   **Indie Brand Quality is the New Standard**: Across multiple "Best of 2025" ranking videos, indie brands consistently outperformed and outranked their mainstream counterparts. Creators explicitly called out poor quality from brands like Morphe and Glamlite, stating that consumers in 2025 expect high-performance formulas regardless of price point. Indie brands are no longer the alternative; for this creator set, they are the benchmark.

-   **The Alternative Winter Aesthetic**: The seasonal narrative has shifted from overtly festive to "moody winter." This is defined by a color palette of deep jewel tones, muted "dingy dusty" shades, rich berries, and icy cool-toned shimmers. This aesthetic appeared in at least three creators' content, influencing their top picks for the season.

-   **Data-Driven Release Fatigue**: The conversation around brand release cadence has matured. Analysis showed that the *perception* of being overwhelmed is tied more to the product category than the sheer number of launches. Indie brands focusing on frequent, high-anticipation eyeshadow palette drops create a stronger sense of fatigue than mainstream brands releasing a higher number of varied products (lip, cheek, face).

-   **Return of Baked Formulas**: A clear trend signal for 2026. The enthusiastic reception to new baked blushes, bronzers, and highlighters from CoverGirl and e.l.f. indicates a market ready for the resurgence of this texture, which offers a smooth, luminous finish without heavy powderiness.

## 5. Purchase-Intent Signals

-   **"Best of the Year" Placement**: Products landing in the top 10 of creators' annual rankings are the strongest possible endorsement, reflecting sustained use and satisfaction. The **Make Up For Ever Superboost Skin Tint** (ranked #1 by Rachel Palmieri) and the **Bella Beaute Bar Ocean Jewel Palette** (ranked #1 by battybean) are prime examples.

-   **Repurchase & "Panning" Proof**: Angelica Nyqvist's "Empties" video provided concrete evidence of products she would or has already repurchased (Olaplex, Amika, Haruharu). Similarly, creators highlighting products they have "hit pan" on (Fenty Bronzer) or nearly finished (MUFE Skin Tint) signals true holy-grail status.

-   **Re-Release Excitement**: The strong, positive reaction to the Oden's Eye holiday palette re-release demonstrates significant latent demand for previously limited-edition items. This "second chance" marketing drives immediate purchase decisions.

-   **Affiliate Code Saturation**: The ubiquitous use of affiliate codes in titles and descriptions for new indie launches (Blend Bunny, Oden's Eye, Lethal Cosmetics) signals a creator's confidence that their audience is ready to buy immediately based on the visual demonstration.

## 6. Opportunities for the Store

-   **Must-Stock Palettes**: Prioritize top-ranked indie palettes with moody, jewel-toned, or gothic color stories. Key brands are **Blend Bunny** (Haunt Me, Beauty Below), **Bella Beaute Bar** (Ocean Jewel, Crystallize), and **Dede Signature** (Broken Jewels).

-   **Expand Cheek Offerings**: Focus on blushes with a satin or "luminous matte" finish, as seen with **Unearthly Cosmetics' Incandescent Blushes**. The rosy-brown color trend is a safe bet. Consider stocking the **Blend Bunny Pro Luster Palette** as a versatile blush topper/highlighter.

-   **Curate Problem-Solvers**: The **Clionadh x BadToTheBrow Shine-On Shimmer Enhancer** was ranked as a top product of the year for preventing shimmer creasing on hooded eyes. Stocking a high-quality, non-goopy glitter primer fills a clear market need.

-   **Invest in High-Performing Lip Liners**: The "lip combo" trend is driving demand for versatile liners. **Unearthly Cosmetics** and **Kaleidos** were both featured in popular pairings.

-   **Avoid High-Risk Complexion**: The negative review of the **Victoria Beckham Foundation** for oily skin suggests it would be a high-risk, high-return item. Focusing on well-loved skin tints and lightweight formulas may be a safer strategy.

-   **Monitor Emerging Trends**: Prepare for the return of baked formulas in 2026. Sourcing baked blushes and highlighters could capture this returning trend early. The rising interest in matcha-scented products is also a key signal for fragrance and body care expansion.
