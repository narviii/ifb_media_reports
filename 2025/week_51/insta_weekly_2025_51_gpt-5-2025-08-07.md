# Weekly Instagram Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key Takeaway (Dec 15–21, 2025): Holiday glam skewed alt and high-shine—icy silvers, lagoon teals, and burgundy accents—while cream highlighters and glitter-heavy eye looks drove the strongest “add to cart” energy. NYX’s Buttermelt highlight stix dominated views and purchase questions; indie sparkle (Oden’s Eye, Dieverune, Blend Bunny) sustained buzz with swatches, pencils, and chromes.
