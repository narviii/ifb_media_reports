# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key takeaway (Dec 15–21, 2025): Holiday-week indie color is dominant, driven by goth/alt festive looks, re-release nostalgia, and lip-oil/gloss pairings. Oden’s Eye’s holiday relaunch and Blend Bunny’s Haunt Me built the most visible momentum, while creators pushed shimmer-enhancers, baked cheek formulas, and moody jewel tones as winter defaults.

## 1. Overview

Creators leaned hard into alternative holiday glam: smoky silvers, blues/teals, deep reds, and high-shine multichromes replaced traditional warm gold/red sets. Short, music-driven reels and affiliate-coded reels/swatch videos were prevalent, signaling a last-minute seasonal conversion push.

There’s visible palette enthusiasm alongside frank curation and fatigue talk. Several year-end rankings put indie palettes at the top (Bella Beaute Bar, Blend Bunny, Gourmande Girls), but creators also urged restraint, highlighted declutters/empties, and called out redundant beige-heavy releases.

Texture talk spiked: shimmers need “assistants” (Clionadh Shine-On, glitter adhesives) to prevent creasing, especially on hooded eyes. Cheek layering (cream/liquid + luminous powder topper) and “glass” but non-greasy highlight were praised across creators.

Lips swung wintry: rich berries/burgundies/reddish-browns, plus lip oils and glossy balms with sensory hooks (honey, gingerbread, mint). Lip combo culture (dark liner + glossy melt/oil) is a reliable engagement driver.

Mainstream luxury faced credibility tests: Victoria Beckham’s foundation was a miss for oily/humid conditions; value-forward skin tints (MUFE Superboost, Armani Golden Hour) won. A “baked face product” revival (e.l.f., CoverGirl, Tarte) and brown tubing mascaras signal 2026 carryover trends.

## 3. Category Trends

- Eyes
  - Momentum: large-format indie palettes; updated re-releases; multichrome-heavy looks; silver/icy lids; blue/teal/purple winter stories; quads/column logic aiding usability.
  - Utilities are normalized: liquid shimmer enhancers/adhesives now “must-have” for high-shine payoff without creasing.

- Cheeks
  - Layering: creams/liquids under satin/luminous powders to build “youthful glow” without glitter. Cool-toned pinks, plums, and rosier browns trend.
  - Baked returns: excitement for baked/marbled blush/highlighter/bronzer formats resurfacing at all price tiers.

- Lips
  - Preference shift to lip oils/glossy balms with scent hooks; winter shades = berries/burgundies/reddish-browns. Black/near-black gloss exists as a statement niche.
  - Lip combo culture fuels repeatable recipes and basket sizes (liner + oil/melt + bullet/cream).

- Base/mascara
  - Lightweight, hydrating skin tints > heavy foundations; grip primers + mattifying touch-up powders for oily T-zones.
  - Brown tubing mascaras earn “holy grail” status; waterproof creamy kajals (VB-style) get cross-creator praise.

- Fatigue/skepticism
  - Palette cadence from indie brands creates perceived saturation; creators ask for 3–5 releases/year. Anti-neutral/anti-beige narratives persist in alt/indie niches.

## 4. Emerging Themes & Narratives

- Re-release + Singles Strategy: Oden’s Eye’s holiday reissues (improved shimmers, singles option) are applauded across creators; implies strong conversion from both new and repeat buyers.
- Shimmer Infrastructure: Clionadh Shine-On (and similar adhesives) are cross-creator staples; “the fix” for specialty shimmers on hooded eyes.
- Alt Holiday Aesthetic: Goth/vampy winter glam (silver smoke, blue/teal lids, deep reds) appears in multiple channels; non-traditional festive looks outperform standard warm gold/red.
- Lip Oils > Mattes: Multiple creators favor lip oils/gloss balms and scented treatments; matte liquids appear mostly as deeper seasonal picks or layered in combos.
- Baked Face Product Comeback: e.l.f./CoverGirl/Tarte launches spark excitement; aligns with satin/glow cheek preferences.
- Mindful Buying: Declutters/empties show curating behavior; creators emphasize utility, performance, and shade uniqueness over volume.
- Regional/brand-origin momentum
  - Western indie: Blend Bunny, Bella Beaute Bar, Unearthly, Nomad, DeDe dominate visibility.
  - Nordic indie: Oden’s Eye surges via re-release model.
  - German indie: Lethal’s Serpentine sustains positive buzz; Spongebob collab anticipation.

## 5. Purchase-Intent Signals

- Strong triggers
  - FOMO + nostalgia: Oden’s Eye holiday palettes “back, better, singles,” plus affiliate discounts.
  - “Best of 2025”/“holy grail” endorsements: MUFE Superboost Skin Tint, VB Satin Kajal liners, Clionadh Shine-On, Blend Bunny Haunt Me/Pro Luster, Bella Beaute Bar Ocean Jewel.
  - Visual proof: high-contrast swatch reels of multichromes and deep mattes; hooded-eye crease tests.
  - Seasonal styling: “moody winter” curation guiding color families (cool pinks, plums, jewel tones) and ready-made combos.
  - Problem/solution: shimmer enhancer to stop creasing; brown tubing mascaras that don’t smudge; cleansing oils that remove sparkle fully.

- Deterrents
  - Oily-skin caution: VB Foundation failed in humidity; alternatives recommended (Armani, MUFE).
  - Shimmer formula risk: flaky/emollient shimmers that crease get penalized quickly.
  - Lip oil texture dissatisfaction: thin, low-color oils (Huda) deprioritized vs cushier/glossier options.

## 6. Opportunities for the Store

- What to stock now
  - Multichrome singles and “shimmer infrastructure”: thin liquid shimmer enhancers/adhesives (Clionadh-like) and high-reflect toppers (glitter pucks or micro-sparkle putties).
  - Winter jewel-tone eye curation: compact palettes or curated singles in blue/teal/purple/silver + deep greens/reds; include cool grays/black mattes that blend smoothly.
  - Cheek layering system: cool-toned pink/plum cream/liquid blushes with satin/luminous powder toppers; add baked/marbled blush/highlighter/bronzer SKUs to meet resurging interest.
  - Lip combo builders: deep brown/gray-beige liners; lip oil–gloss hybrids (including unusual shades like black/near-black and reddish-brown); C-beauty-style glossy “lip melt” textures.
  - Eye detailers: waterproof creamy kajals (rich brown/green), brown tubing mascaras.
  - Removal support: K-beauty cleansing oils that remove glitter thoroughly (e.g., Haruharu-like), gentle gel cleansers.

- Merchandising/bundles
  - “Alt Holiday Glam Kit”: deep matte quad + silver/icy topper + brown kajal + brown tubing mascara + berry/burgundy lip.
  - “Moody Winter Cheeks”: cool pink/plum cream + baked topper + glass-skin stick highlighter.
  - “Shimmer Survival Set (Hooded Eyes)”: shimmer enhancer + multichrome single + precise flat shader + mini setting spray.

- Demand rising
  - Oden’s Eye–style re-releases with singles options: anticipate and mirror via stocking refillable/single pans for popular shades; push “build-your-quad” tools.
  - Scented lip care: honey/gingerbread/mint make easy add-ons and gifts.
  - Value skin tints: MUFE Superboost/Armani-like wear claims; ensure olive undertones coverage.

- Where to be cautious
  - Heavy, dewy foundations for oily/humid regions (higher return risk) without clear undertone breadth.
  - Shimmer formulas prone to creasing or fallout; test and back only those that pass hooded-eye trials.
  - Palette volume: focus on fewer, highly distinctive stories and provide singles/refills to combat release fatigue.

- Gaps to fill
  - Olive-undertone shade extensions in skin tints and bronzers.
  - True brown tubing mascara at mid-price point.
  - Black/near-black gloss with comfortable, non-sticky finish.
  - Educational content: quick “look recipes” pairing enhancer + multichrome + liner + lip combo to mimic creator-favorite aesthetics; drive basket-building with saveable routine pages.

Overall: Lean into alt-winter jewel tones, shimmer-support utilities, lip oils/combo kits, and baked face products. Use singles/refillable strategies to meet enthusiasm while respecting fatigue and curation behavior.
