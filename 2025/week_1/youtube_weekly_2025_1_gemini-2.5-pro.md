# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

The first week of 2025, covering January 1–5, was characterized by a transition from 2024 retrospectives to initial testing of new year releases, with indie brands and nostalgia-driven collaborations generating the most significant early excitement.

## 1. Overview

The week's content reflected a dual focus: creators concluded 2024 with "best of," "worst of," and large-scale declutter videos, while simultaneously beginning to test the first wave of 2025 products. This created a mood of both reflection and forward-looking curiosity.

Conversation was heavily skewed towards the indie space. Multiple creators tested or praised palettes and lip products from brands like Singe Beauty, Unearthly Cosmetics, and Wicked Widow. This indicates a strong, continued interest in unique color stories and formulas that diverge from mainstream offerings.

Drugstore brands also made an impact with a slate of new complexion products, primarily skin tints and stick formulas. This suggests the "skinification" of makeup and demand for lighter coverage options continues to be a key mass-market trend heading into the new year.

Finally, anticipation is building around several upcoming releases. The announcement of a Beauty Creations x Polly Pocket collaboration generated significant buzz across multiple channels, highlighting the potent marketing power of '90s nostalgia.

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

-   **Singe Beauty Galactic Visitor Palette:** This palette saw the most significant cross-creator momentum. It was featured by the brand owner (Angelica Nyqvist) and subsequently tested positively by Rachel Palmieri and used in a look by battybean. This trifecta of mentions signals strong initial adoption and positive word-of-mouth within the creator community.

-   **Unearthly Cosmetics Menacing Metals Lipsticks:** Mentioned as a favorite by battybean and featured by Rachel Palmieri. The focus on a metallic finish suggests a potential shift away from the dominance of matte and glossy formulas. Sentiment is positive, centered on the unique formula and color range.

-   **Salt New York Mood Lighting (Cream Blush):** Featured in first impressions (Rachel Palmieri) and in a product combination short (battybean). The continued visibility of this product reinforces the staying power of multi-use cream cheek products.

-   **Adept Cosmetics & Wicked Widow Beauty Palettes:** Both brands were highlighted in battybean's "favorites" video, a strong indicator of sustained positive performance and user satisfaction. The Adept Duality Blush Palette and Wicked Widow Tales of Terror eyeshadow palette were specifically named.

-   **New Drugstore Complexion:** The **Milani Conceal + Perfect Blur Out Skin Tint Stick** and **NYX Buttermelt Face Palette** were featured in "testing new makeup" videos. The conversation is currently in the initial discovery phase, with creators evaluating texture, blendability, and wear time.

-   **Upcoming Releases Generating Hype:** The **Beauty Creations x Polly Pocket** collection and the **Ace Beaute Whimsical Bloom Palette** were discussed in multiple "new releases" segments, building anticipation before launch.

## 3. Category Trends

-   **Eyeshadow Palettes:** This category remains central, driven entirely by indie brands this week. The focus is on unique color stories and special effect shades (shimmers, multichromes). The excitement around the Polly Pocket collection also points to a demand for palettes tied to strong thematic or nostalgic concepts.

-   **Blush:** Momentum continues for liquid and cream formulas. Creators are demonstrating specific application techniques, such as layering cream blush (Salt NY) under a luminous powder blush (Rare Beauty), as shown by battybean. This points to a more sophisticated user base interested in texture combinations.

-   **Lips:** A bifurcation is visible. On one hand, comfortable, glossy balms and stains (NYX Lip IV, ColourPop Fresh Kiss) are being tested. On the other, more impactful formulas like metallic lipsticks (Unearthly) are gaining traction as standout products.

-   **Complexion:** The trend is toward lightweight, easy-to-apply formats. The new stick tints and foundations from Milani and Maybelline signal a market desire for convenient, natural-finish base products.

## 4. Emerging Themes & Narratives

-   **Nostalgia as a Primary Purchase Driver:** The announcement of the Beauty Creations x Polly Pocket collaboration was a key topic in new release roundups (Angelica Nyqvist, Rachel Palmieri). This confirms that intellectual property from the '90s and early 2000s remains a highly effective tool for generating immediate, widespread interest, particularly for affordably priced collections.

-   **Creator-to-Founder Pipeline Validation:** The positive, organic-feeling reception of the Singe Beauty palette by creators other than the founder demonstrates the viability of this business model. When the product is strong, the creator community is willing to embrace and promote brands launched by their peers.

-   **C-Beauty's Aesthetic Appeal:** The inclusion of Flower Knows in new release and collection review videos (Angelica Nyqvist, Heather Austin) signals that C-Beauty brands continue to capture attention in the West. The narrative is less about formula innovation and more about the appeal of their hyper-feminine, ornate packaging and cohesive collection themes.

## 5. Purchase-Intent Signals

-   **Inclusion in "Favorites" Videos:** Battybean's monthly favorites video serves as a strong purchase signal for products that have been tested over time. The specific mention of palettes from **Wicked Widow Beauty** and **Adept Cosmetics**, and lipsticks from **Unearthly Cosmetics**, implies a high degree of satisfaction and a strong recommendation.

-   **Cross-Creator Validation:** The Singe Beauty palette being used and reviewed positively by three separate creators in a single week is the strongest signal of rising demand. This type of organic amplification often directly translates to sales.

-   **Expressed Anticipation for New Launches:** Creators like Rachel Palmieri and Angelica Nyqvist explicitly stated excitement for the **Ace Beaute Whimsical Bloom Palette** and the **Beauty Creations x Polly Pocket** collection. This pre-launch hype often indicates that a product will see a strong sales spike upon release.

## 6. Opportunities for the Store

-   **Prioritize Stocking:** The **Singe Beauty Galactic Visitor Palette** should be a high-priority item to consider stocking, given the strong, multi-creator validation this week. **Unearthly Cosmetics Menacing Metals Lipsticks** also show clear demand.

-   **Expand Blush Offerings:** The trend of layering blush textures is an opportunity. Consider stocking both high-quality cream blushes (like Salt NY) and complementary luminous powder blushes. Marketing them as a pair could appeal to the engaged consumer base learning these techniques from creators.

-   **Monitor Nostalgia Trend:** The Polly Pocket excitement indicates a market gap for playful, nostalgia-themed makeup. While not directly stocking that collection, consider indie alternatives that tap into similar retro or toy-inspired aesthetics.

-   **Evaluate Metallic Lips:** The positive reception of the Unearthly metallic lipsticks suggests an opening in the market. This could be a point of differentiation from competitors focusing solely on matte and gloss formulas.
