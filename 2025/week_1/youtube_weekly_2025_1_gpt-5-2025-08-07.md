# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key takeaway: The week ending Jan 5, 2025 (Dec 30, 2024–Jan 5, 2025) opened with “reset” content—declutters, worst-of lists, and first impressions—while indie color launches and blush-heavy looks drove most enthusiasm.

## 1. Overview

Creator energy skewed toward curation and scrutiny. Declutters and “worst of 2024/what to avoid” videos set a skeptical tone, especially for new drugstore complexion claims and celebrity/mainstream drops.

Countering that, indie color made the week feel lively: shimmer toppers, multichromes, and blush stacks dominated actual usage. Blush layering and lip oils/gloss stains surfaced across multiple creators as the easiest “new year refresh” adds.

Value talk split into two lanes: drugstore “greatest hits” recaps (positive) versus “new 2025 at the drugstore: be careful” (mixed-to-negative), with repeated concern around skin tints/sticks promising blur/glow but underperforming.

Aesthetically, creators gravitated to neutrals-with-twist palettes plus reflective toppers. BYOP/curation (build-your-own palettes tied to themes) popped up again, signaling appetite for customizable kits.

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

- Top mentioned indie products
  - Singe Beauty Galactic Visitor palette: used across creators (Rachel Palmieri; Battybean; Angelica referencing her brand). Sentiment: positive usage momentum; reliable “canvas” for toppers.
  - Salt New York Mood Lighting + Sneaky Balm/Concealer: repeated usage and a featured blush combo. Sentiment: positive; glow without heaviness.
  - Unearthly Cosmetics Menacing Metals lipsticks and Just a Taste (highlighter/lip oils): multiple mentions and swatches. Sentiment: positive; metallic lips seen as fun but wearable.
  - Menagerie Moonlit Metal toppers: repeatedly layered over looks. Sentiment: strong positive; toppers are the “interest add-on.”
  - Adept Duality Blush palette (and Unity palette in discussion): in favorites and roundup reviews; brand halo amplified by creator collabs. Sentiment: positive; cool/pink tones appreciated.
  - Wicked Widow Beauty Tales of Terror (and upcoming American Psycho collab): active discussion + prior favorites. Sentiment: positive; gothic/alt indie maintaining heat.
  - Arttitude Cosmetics neutrals (Vintage/Urban) and Metamorph: used in looks and reviews. Sentiment: positive; “neutrals with shift” becoming a default comparison set.
  - Cosmic Brushes cream blushes and lipstick: repeat favorites. Sentiment: positive; creamy textures with autumnal tones still trending post-holidays.
  - Ace Beauté Whimsical Bloom: early-cycle buzz across news videos. Sentiment: cautiously positive; seen as fresh among early 2025 releases.
