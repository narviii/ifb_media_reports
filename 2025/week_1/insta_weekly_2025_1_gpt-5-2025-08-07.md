# Weekly Instagram Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key Takeaway: For the week ending Jan 2, 2025 (Dec 27, 2024–Jan 2, 2025), sparkly, shifty shimmer swatches and curated mini palettes took center stage, led by Glaminatrix’s new 6-pan format; audience enthusiasm clustered around the green and pink color stories, with curiosity but limited explicit buy signals.

## 1. Overview

- The Vibe: Swatch-heavy carousel content highlighting texture and payoff. Narrative centered on formula performance (sparkly shimmers, dry-but-blendable mattes) and usability (magnetic, travel-friendly, mix-and-match).
- Engagement Temperature: Warm-positive. Comments leaned toward aesthetic preference (“the green one!”) and approval of the palette structure; few direct purchase or technical-usage questions.

## 2. Product Momentum (Brand & Item Velocity)

- Top Mentioned Brands:
  - Glaminatrix Cosmetics (PR feature; affiliate code disclosed)

- Viral Products:
  - Glaminatrix mini 6-pan palettes (magnetic, small pan size)
  - Standouts by name: Exquisite Eyes (green), Entrancing Eyes (pink)
  - Differentiators driving attention: shifty topper in the pink palette; “piecey, sparkly” topper in the green palette perceived as most impactful

- The “Look” Breakdown (textures and repeated choices):
  - Eyes: Consistent “recipe” per palette = light/medium/deep matte + topper shimmer + mid-tone shimmer + deep shimmer; at least one shifty shade each
  - Finishes/Textures:
    - Shimmers: Impactful, sparkly, not too flaky or squishy; shifty toppers are a key hook
    - Mattes: On the drier side yet pigmented and very blendable
  - Repetition/Redundancy:
    - Toppers across most palettes read similarly in tone; green and pink toppers feel most distinct to users

## 3. Aesthetic & Hashtag Trends

- Visual Themes:
  - Indie sparkle-first eye looks, swatch carousels, curated mini-palette storytelling
  - Travel-friendly, customizable magnetic formats
- Hashtag Signals:
  - #glitter #eyeshadow #eyeshadowpalette #indiemakeup #colorfulmakeup
- Color Stories:
  - Strong pull to green and pink monochromes; range of depth within mattes is praised (especially the green palette)

## 4. Purchase-Intent Signals (From Comments)

- “Add to Cart” Energy:
  - Soft intent via preference declarations (“love the green one,” “really liking the pink and green”); no explicit “ordered/need” language
- Restock Demands:
  - None observed
- Curiosity Clusters:
  - Low volume of questions; audience fixated more on shade family preference than performance concerns (implies trust in the brand’s shimmer formula)

## 5. Opportunities for the Store

- Stocking Recommendations:
  - Prioritize Glaminatrix mini 6-pan palettes, especially:
    - Green (Exquisite Eyes): perceived as the most dimensional topper + strong matte range
    - Pink (Entrancing Eyes): notable shifty topper that feels distinct
  - Complementary singles: highly sparkly/shifty topper singles in varied tones to address perceived topper redundancy
- Content Strategy:
  - Swatch carousels comparing toppers side-by-side resonated; expand with macro sparkle videos and topper-only comparison clips
  - Lean into “travel/editable palette” narratives and magnetic mix-and-match demos
- Gap Analysis:
  - Creator critique: topper similarity across palettes
  - Opportunity: curate or bundle topper singles with clearly different undertones/textures (icy vs. pink vs. chartreuse vs. champagne vs. lavender shifts) to reduce redundancy fatigue

## 6. Special insights

- Emerging Micro-Trends:
  - “Curated mini monochromes” with a fixed matte-to-shimmer recipe—users appreciate predictable structure with one standout topper
  - Preference for high-impact sparkly shimmers that aren’t flaky—texture control matters
- Unexpected Pairings:
  - Magnetic minis encouraging cross-palette mixing; potential to position toppers as interchangeable “finishers” across any matte base
- Creative insight:
  - Launch a “Topper Lab” experience: select-your-shift bundles that contrast distinctly (e.g., wet-look ethereal vs. piecey glitter vs. foil-shift) and pair with a 3-matte core quad. Offer a green and a pink starter to mirror the strongest interest signals.
