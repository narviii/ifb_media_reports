# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

For the week ending December 7, 2025, the YouTube beauty landscape was dominated by a surge of holiday and winter-themed eyeshadow palettes from indie brands, driving a narrative focused on formula nuance, collection curation, and the exceptional value offered by independent companies.

## 1. Overview

This week was characterized by an intense focus on indie eyeshadow palettes, with creators simultaneously navigating excitement for new holiday releases and a reflective mood of collection management. The conversation was analytical, with detailed critiques of eyeshadow textures—specifically the performance of mattes and the finish of shimmers ("wet-look" vs. "dry" or "metallic"). Creators like Angelica Nyqvist provided specific feedback on how formulas performed on hooded or mature eyelids, a recurring theme that adds a layer of practical performance testing to reviews.

A clear tension emerged between the influx of new products and a growing desire for conscious consumption. Large-scale declutter videos from battybean and Angelica Nyqvist ran alongside first impressions of the latest collections, signaling a more discerning approach to purchasing. Battybean’s "Palettes I Almost Bought" video epitomized this sentiment, where aesthetic appreciation was often outweighed by practical considerations like shade redundancy or formula uncertainty.

While eyeshadow was the primary focus, blush layering techniques and "lip combos" also gained traction, particularly in short-form content. The value proposition of holiday gift sets was another key topic, with creators like Manny Mua and Angelica Nyqvist critically assessing mainstream offerings, often concluding that curated sets from retailers like Sephora provided superior value over single-brand kits.

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

**Bella Beauté Bar Crystallize Palette:** This palette generated the most significant positive momentum. It was universally praised across multiple channels (battybean, Angelica Nyqvist, Heather Austin, Noopur Makeup) for its "stunning" cool-toned, icy color story and high-impact multichrome shimmers. Described as a "dream" and a "stunner," its launch timing and strong creator endorsements signal high purchase intent.

**Unearthly Cosmetics Dead Cute Collection:** This collection saw widespread positive reception for its unique "acid pastel rainbow" aesthetic. Creators were excited by the vibrant eyeshadow palette, heart-shaped blush quad, and unconventional lipstick shades. Angelica Nyqvist and Rachel Palmieri gave positive first impressions, though Angelica noted some mattes felt unusually hard-pressed for the brand.

**Lethal Cosmetics Serpentine Palette:** Received positive feedback for its creative, dark, and unique color story. Creators like Rachel Palmieri and Heather Austin were drawn to its distinctive theme, marking it as a strong, non-collaboration release.

**Simply Posh Gingerbread Bakery Palette:** Sentiment was consistently mixed-to-negative. While the theme was considered cute, multiple creators (Angelica Nyqvist, Rachel Palmieri, battybean) noted performance issues, specifically that the pastel mattes were "thin," "weak," or "needed building up." This consistent critique suggests a potential disconnect between aesthetic appeal and formula execution.

**Cosmic Brushes The Death Tarot Palette:** Praised for its high-quality formula and interesting textures. However, both Angelica Nyqvist and battybean noted that the gray-leaning shades were not personally flattering, a specific critique that indicates the color story may not suit all undertones.

**Product Combos:** Battybean demonstrated several product combinations, indicating synergistic potential.
- **Blush:** Colourpop City Walk Liquid Blush + Lunar Beauty Moon Prism Palette; Lawless Gumdrop Cream Blush + Rare Beauty Cheer Luminous Blush.
- **Lips:** Kaleidos Hickory Pencil + Sugarpill Flicker Gloss; Kaleidos Mauvement Pencil + Likely Makeup Silverpink Pony Liquid Lip.

## 3. Category Trends

**Eyeshadow Palettes:** This category dominated the week, driven entirely by indie brand holiday and winter releases. The focus was on unique color stories that offered versatility beyond simple seasonal themes.

**Blush:** Layering techniques showed momentum, with creators demonstrating the combination of a liquid or cream blush base with a powder blush topper. This method is used to achieve enhanced dimension, glow, and longevity.

**Lip Products:** Lip liners, glosses, and balms were frequently featured, often in the context of creating customized "lip combos." However, there was also clear fatigue with the tinted lip balm category, as seen in commentary that Patrick Ta's release was "late to the game."

**Aesthetics & Textures:** Two primary aesthetics emerged: the vibrant, playful, and colorful look of the Unearthly Dead Cute collection, and the cool-toned, icy, ethereal vibe of the Bella Beauté Bar Crystallize palette. Across the board, "wet-look," "glossy," and highly reflective multichrome shimmers were the most desired finishes.

## 4. Emerging Themes & Narratives

- **Indie Brand Dominance:** The conversation was almost exclusively centered on indie brands (Bella Beauté Bar, Unearthly, Lethal, Simply Posh, etc.). Mainstream brands were primarily discussed in the context of value-driven gift sets or as points of comparison, reinforcing the narrative that innovation and excitement are currently concentrated in the indie space.

- **Conscious Curation:** The presence of extensive declutter videos alongside reviews of new products highlights a significant theme of mindful collection management. Creators are articulating clear, often strict, criteria for what they keep, focusing on unique formulas and color stories while actively avoiding redundancy. This signals a shift from accumulation to curation.

- **Nuanced Formula Critiques:** Creator commentary has become increasingly specific. Instead of broad "good" or "bad" judgments, feedback focused on granular details: matte "thinness" (Simply Posh), shimmer "dryness" requiring a wet brush (Rachel Palmieri on Simply Posh), and shimmer performance on hooded eyes (Angelica Nyqvist on Danessa Myricks). This detailed analysis provides highly specific performance data.

## 5. Purchase-Intent Signals

- **High-Impact Endorsements:** The Bella Beauté Bar Crystallize palette received repeated, high-praise descriptions like "dream" and "stunner" from multiple creators, often paired with affiliate codes for its launch. This concerted enthusiasm is a powerful driver of purchase intent.

- **Value-Driven Gift Sets:** The Sephora Favorites Perfume Sampler sets were strongly recommended by both Manny Mua and Angelica Nyqvist as "worth the money" and a solution to the difficulty of gifting fragrances. The inclusion of a voucher for a full-size product was consistently highlighted as a key value driver.

- **Anticipation for New Launches:** Strong positive sentiment was expressed for upcoming or teased products from trusted indie brands like Blend Bunny and Unearthly Cosmetics ("Made a Monster" palette), indicating that brand reputation is building pre-launch hype.

- **Creator-Identified Market Gaps:** Angelica Nyqvist's mention of creating her own orange lip liner for her brand, Singe Beauty, because she couldn't find a suitable option, signals a potential unmet need in the market for unique lip liner shades.

## 6. Opportunities for the Store

- **Must-Stock Items:** The Bella Beauté Bar Crystallize palette is the highest-priority item based on this week's media signals. The Unearthly Cosmetics Dead Cute collection also shows strong demand, particularly the eyeshadow and blush palettes.

- **Category Expansion:** Consider stocking products that facilitate trending techniques. This includes liquid/cream blushes and complementary luminous powder blushes for layering. A curated selection of lip liners and glosses marketed as "lip combos" could also perform well.

- **Products to Approach with Caution:** The Simply Posh Gingerbread Bakery palette has consistent, cross-creator critiques regarding its matte formula. While visually appealing, it may lead to customer disappointment. The gray-heavy color story of the Cosmic Brushes Death Tarot palette might have a more niche appeal.

- **Market Gaps:** There appears to be an opportunity for unique and unconventional lip liner shades, particularly in warm-toned and non-traditional colors, to complement the bold lipsticks offered by many indie brands.
