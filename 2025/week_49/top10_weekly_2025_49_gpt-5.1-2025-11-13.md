# Weekly Top 10 Indie Makeup Product Mentions

**Reporting Period:** December 01–07, 2025

1. **Crystallize / Crystallize Eyeshadow Palette by Bella Beaute Bar** — 15 mentions  
   Crystallize is heavily featured across YouTube and Instagram as a standout winter release, praised for its cool-toned, icy/pastel-neutral color story and ethereal, topper-style shimmers. Creators consistently highlight its silky, blendable mattes and light, reflective multichromes that give a “wet look” sparkle, with Hematite called out as the one opaque, galaxy-like shimmer. While one creator notes the bone matte isn’t personally useful and that Lapis Lazuli needs a bit more building, overall sentiment is strongly positive, with multiple reviewers calling it their favorite or new favorite Bella Beaute Bar palette and pairing it with deeper palettes like Coalescence.

2. **Dead Cute Palette / Dead Cute Color Palette by Unearthly Cosmetics** — 13 mentions  
   The Dead Cute eyeshadow palette is repeatedly described as a loud, playful, neon-leaning color story with no neutrals, combining bright mattes and glossy, multichrome shimmers. YouTube creators emphasize its strong pigmentation (especially purples) and the “insane” multichrome Psycho Sweetie shade, while noting a few mattes/shimmers felt underwhelming in swatches and some pans are harder-pressed than typical for the brand. Overall sentiment is positive, with multiple looks, unboxings, and “full collection” reels positioning it as a fun, spooky-cute release for colorful eye looks.

3. **Ice Crystal / Holiday Ice Crystal / Ice Crystal Palette by Oden’s Eye** — 11 mentions  
   Ice Crystal is framed as a whimsical, wintery pastel palette with strong shimmer performance and a large, visually striking layout. Angelica ranks it mid-pack in a palette ranking, loving the packaging and shimmers but critiquing it as too light-leaning with grayish dark tones that don’t give enough depth; battybean and Heather Austin, by contrast, describe it as “colorful, wintery cute” with great quality pastels and wet-looking shimmers. Oden’s Eye’s own Instagram and swatch content reinforce its role as a centerpiece winter release with varied finishes and shapes, and sentiment is overall positive despite some size and depth critiques.

4. **Gingerbread Bakery Palette / Gingerbread Bakery Shadow Palette by Simply Posh Cosmetics** — 10 mentions  
   Gingerbread Bakery appears frequently in declutters and reviews, with sentiment split by creator. Angelica ranks it last in a holiday ranking, loving the color story but calling the pastel mattes thin and weak, while battybean ultimately declutters it despite praising its beautiful, wet-looking shimmers and wintery theme. Rachel Palmieri offers the most positive take, calling the packaging cute and whimsical, the mattes easy to work with (with a couple of finicky pastels) and the shimmers pretty but sometimes dry enough to benefit from a sticky base, positioning it as versatile for both monochromatic and mixed looks.

5. **Serpentine / Serpentine Eyeshadow Palette by Lethal Cosmetics** — 7 mentions  
   Serpentine is framed as a unique, dark-leaning color story with muted and bright pops plus neutrals, wrapped in snake-motif packaging that multiple creators call “gorgeous.” Angelica first uses it on camera and later posts swatches, noting strong pigmentation and vibrant metallics/multichromes, while Rachel Palmieri emphasizes the impressive mattes and the Rattle multichrome, which feels slightly dry/hard-pan to the touch but applies beautifully over primer. Across posts, sentiment is clearly positive, with excitement that this is a non-collab Lethal release and interest in its curated, moody color story.

6. **Artificer Palette / Artifice Palette by Fantasy Cosmetica** — 6 mentions  
   Fantasy Cosmetica’s Artificer/Artifice palette is repeatedly highlighted as a “spicy neutral” or steampunk-inspired color story mixing cool browns, peaches, golds, and a marbled green split-pan shimmer. Angelica builds a peach-and-brown look and calls the result “pretty dang good,” especially praising the Alchemy split shade, while battybean underscores the brand’s very pigmented mattes and sparkly, shifty shimmers and uses the palette both alone and with coordinating singles. Sentiment is consistently positive, with creators framing it as a high-quality neutral-with-a-twist option for those who like special shimmers but don’t always wear bright colors.

7. **Come Play With Us Palette by Bella Beauté Bar** — 4 mentions  
   In Angelica’s ranking video, Come Play With Us is crowned her #1 favorite holiday palette, described as Halloween on the outside but a “Christmas palette” inside, with cohesive rows of blues, reds, greens, and neutrals that allow full monochromatic looks. She notes that while some shimmers crease on her, most don’t—she specifically wore the red shimmer all day without creasing—and she loves the pop of neutrals and the ability to build full green or red matte/shimmer duos. Overall sentiment is strongly positive, positioning it as a versatile, cross-seasonal indie staple.

8. **Festive Elegance Palette by DeDe Signature** — 4 mentions  
   Festive Elegance is consistently praised as one of the prettiest and most luxurious-looking Christmas palettes, with rich jewel-toned reds, greens, and a unique purply-brown that still works year-round. Angelica calls it one of the prettiest holiday palettes of the year with great quality and non-creasing metallics, while battybean echoes that the shimmers are beautiful and the mattes perform well, highlighting the brand’s aesthetic and formula improvements. Heather Austin also describes it as both a Christmas and year-round color story, reinforcing its versatility and strong positive reception.

9. **How The Grinch Stole Christmas / How the Grinch Stole Christmas Palette by ColourPop** — 4 mentions  
   Angelica ranks this ColourPop palette mid-pack but still calls it one of her favorite ColourPop releases of the year, citing the brand’s usual good quality while wishing for one more matte green and noting the Super Shock shades are a bit too emollient to pick up easily with a brush. Battybean enjoys the “Who-ville” themed color story with dusty pinks, berries, and limited greens, saying the formula is on the better end for ColourPop. Overall, sentiment is mixed-to-positive: creators like the fun packaging and performance but see room for improvement in shade balance and some textures.

10. **Dead Cute Lipsticks / Dead Cute Lipstick Set by Unearthly Cosmetics** — 4 mentions  
   The Dead Cute Lipstick Set is repeatedly showcased as an unconventional, highly pigmented lineup featuring a light grey (Ghost Milk), bright pink (Bubble Scream), metallic lime green (Toxic Taffy), and deep metallic berry (Vampire Truffle). Battybean and Xander both highlight the “so cool” metallics and strong color payoff, with Xander calling Vampire Truffle extremely long-wearing and visually striking. Courtney Quarantine later singles out Ghost Milk as a very pale grey-mauve mixer shade she’s “thoroughly in love” with, emphasizing the creamy Menacing Cream formula and its usefulness for custom lip combos, leading to an overall very positive, niche-enthusiast reception.
