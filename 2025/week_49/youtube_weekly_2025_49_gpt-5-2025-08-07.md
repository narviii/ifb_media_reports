# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key takeaway: Nov 30–Dec 7, 2025 saw indie palettes dominate conversation, with cool-toned “icy” stories, sparkly multichromes that don’t crease, and combo content (blush and lips) driving purchase intent. Multiple creators rallied behind specific launches (Bella Beauté Bar Crystallize, Unearthly Dead Cute, Lethal Serpentine), signaling near-term demand.

## 1. Overview

This week felt decisively indie-led and sparkle-forward. Creators gravitated to high-impact shimmers and multichromes that photograph beautifully yet hold up on hooded/aging lids—explicitly calling out creasing-prone, flaky formulas as non-starters. 

Holiday palettes were abundant, but the standouts skewed cool, icy, and jewel-toned rather than only red/green. There’s visible fatigue around pastel mattes that lack grip and oversized formats; “neutrals with interest” (steampunk/terracotta, olive-grunge, muted jewel) continued to pull creators in.

Combo culture drove daily content: layered blush (cream + luminous powder) and lip liner + gloss/liquid lip looked ubiquitous, pitched as long-wear, high-dimension solutions. Declutter/collection content reinforced curation and “no duplicates” behavior, raising the bar on formula and color-story differentiation.

Value narratives bifurcated: shoppers want either (1) indie-grade effects at fair prices or (2) mainstream gift sets with real savings. Overpriced, mini-heavy kits and thin-textured color were openly discouraged.

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

- Bella Beauté Bar Crystallize (eyes)
  - Momentum: Very high. Multiple creators swatched, demoed, and posted release-day details/codes.
  - Sentiment: Strongly positive on shifty multichromes (small particle, smooth, high impact) and balanced cool-toned story with usable mattes. Minor notes: limited very-deep mattes.
  - Context: “Icy” winter aesthetic; no-glitter-glue opacity praised; clear urgency (launch timing, codes).

- Unearthly Cosmetics Dead Cute (palette, blush quad, lipsticks, glosses)
  - Momentum: High. Full-collection swatches, eye looks, and lip demos across creators.
  - Sentiment: Positive on pigmented mattes, glossy shimmers, and long-wearing metallic lipsticks; lip oils seen as “grippy” and durable. One creator flagged some “hard-pressed” shadows on swatch but not in looks.
  - Context: Alternative/goth-cute theme resonated; metallic/green/berry lip shades praised for uniqueness.

- Lethal Cosmetics Serpentine (palette, Infinity Lip Stain, BYOP singles, balm)
  - Momentum: High. Visual swatches, multi-looks, and longevity tests for lip stains.
  - Sentiment: Positive on color story (dark with bright pops), smooth multichrome ('Rattle'), and unusually durable, moisturizing lip stains. Slight dryness in one shimmer pan mitigated by primer.
  - Context: Non-collab indie launch with supporting lip/accessory SKUs; BYOP singles reignite personalization.

- Fantasy Cosmetica Artificer (neutrals with “special” shimmers)
  - Momentum: Moderate-to-high. Several looks and positive formula mentions.
  - Sentiment: Positive shift toward “spicy neutral” looks; marbled/dual shades applauded. Seen as wear-everyday without losing indie “special” sparkle.

- Klarity Kosmetics The Other Side (eyes)
  - Momentum: Moderate. One full look with urgency note (low stock).
  - Sentiment: Positive—vibrant mattes, impactful shimmers; “born to not fit in” narrative matched palette’s grungy-jewel positioning.

- Oden’s Eye Ice Crystal; Nomad Christkindlmarkt; Cosmic Brushes Death Tarot
  - Momentum: Sustained. Reappraisals and multiple favorites lists.
  - Sentiment: Positive on shiny “wet” shimmers and brand value; some creators avoid gray-leaning depths on certain skintones.

- Simply Posh Gingerbread Bakery
  - Momentum: High mentions with split sentiment.
  - Sentiment: Mixed-to-negative around thin/weak pastel mattes and drier shimmers; some users liked theme and versatility but not a “perfect palette” for frequent use.

- Highlighters
  - dieverune Rainbow Highlighter named a favorite; declutter content underscored preference for wet/iridescent or duochrome over icy-minty casts or metallic-heavy textures that read dry.

- Mainstream value references (context for store curation)
  - Manny MUA elevated: Sephora fragrance samplers, The Ordinary minis, Sol de Janeiro sets; warned against poor-value sanitizer kits and mini-heavy, high-price advents.

- Product combos observed
  - Blush: Lawless Cream + Rare Beauty Luminous; Likely Makeup Cream + Kaleidos Powder; ColourPop Liquid + Lunar Beauty Powder.
  - Lips: Kaleidos liners + Sugarpill gloss or Likely Makeup liquid lips; Angelica’s orange lip edited with Singe Beauty Jazzed Juniper liner to “wearable” tone.

Clusters noted:
- “Lots of creators testing Bella Beauté Bar Crystallize.”
- Lethal Infinity Lip Stains positioned as durable winners.
- Repeat criticism: flaky, emollient shimmers that crease; pastel mattes lacking grip; thick-feel lipsticks.

## 3. Category Trends

- Eyeshadows: The engine of the week. Cool-toned/icy, jewel-toned holiday, and olive/grunge stories dominated. Multichrome/duochrome textures remain the draw; creators want sparkle that adheres and doesn’t crease.
- Lips: Rise of long-wear stains and metallics; deep/cool-toned brown liners filled a clear gap (BBB’s new liners celebrated). Layering liner + gloss/liquid for dimension was common.
- Cheeks: Blush layering is mainstream—cream under luminous powder for longevity and glow. Luminous powder blushes that act like blush-highlighter hybrids are favored.
- Highlighter: “Wet look” and iridescent toppers win; overly metallic or icy-minty tones were decluttered.
- Nails/tools: Mooncat collab polishes praised for wear/variety; Fantasy Cosmetica’s magnetic depoting tool appreciated by BYOP users.
- Seasonal shift: Move toward “light winter” aesthetics—lavender, cool pinks, icy blues/purples, with selective fiery pops (orange/chartreuse) for contrast.

## 4. Emerging Themes & Narratives

- Indie > Mainstream for special effects and value: Multiple creators contrasted flaky/overpriced mainstream shimmer palettes with indie multichromes at better value.
- Sparkle that behaves: Cross-creator emphasis on shimmers that are shiny/wet-looking yet non-creasing and not overly emollient—especially for hooded/texture-prone lids.
- Cool-toned/icy winter stories: Consistent across Bella Beauté Bar Crystallize, Oden’s Eye Ice Crystal, and seasonal looks.
- Personalization/BYOP: Lethal singles and creator BYOPs point to ongoing consumer desire to curate shades they’ll actually use.
- Combo culture: Layered blush and liner-centric lip routines widely adopted to customize finish/wear.
- Conscious curation: Declutters and “palettes I almost bought” content nudge buyers toward uniqueness and away from duplication.
- Regional momentum:
  - European indies: Lethal (Germany), Cosmic Brushes (UK), Oden’s Eye (Sweden) maintained high visibility and positive sentiment.
  - Western indies: Strong week for US-based Bella Beauté Bar, Unearthly, Nomad, Fantasy Cosmetica.
  - C-beauty: Kaleidos continued to pop in liners/lip melts across looks.

## 5. Purchase-Intent Signals

- High intent:
  - Bella Beauté Bar Crystallize: Multi-creator swatches, “drops now/tomorrow,” codes, and “stunner/dream” language.
  - Unearthly Dead Cute: Full-collection coverage; standout metallic lipstick wear; themed cohesion.
  - Lethal Serpentine + Infinity Lip Stain: Longevity proofs, moisturizing claims, and positive color story reception.
  - Deep/cool brown lip liners (new BBB shades): Explicit “this is what we asked for” feedback loop.
- Medium intent:
  - Fantasy Cosmetica Artificer: Neutral-with-interest looks praised by previously color-leaning creators—indicates broader buying base.
  - Klarity The Other Side: Stock scarcity callouts + positive looks drive FOMO.
- Cautionary:
  - Pastel-heavy palettes with thin mattes and dry shimmers show resistance unless performance is addressed.
  - Thick lipstick formulas drew negative feedback; metallics with smooth wear fared better.

What will convert:
- Bundled guidance (which shimmer doesn’t need glue, what’s hooded-eye friendly).
- Creator-coded urgency (launch dates, low stock).
- Clear wear claims (non-creasing shimmers; lip stain longevity).
- Combos (blush and lip pairings) framed as turnkey looks.
