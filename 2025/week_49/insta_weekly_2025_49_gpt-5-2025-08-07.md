## 5. Opportunities for the Store

- Stocking Recommendations:
  - Sparkle/Toppers:
    - Multichrome/iridescent toppers and flakes akin to Cosmic Shift, Crystallize, Clionadh singles; include glitter/tacky bases and flat shader brushes.
    - Icy silver/blue toppers (Dose of Colors Frost analogs) to satisfy “magpie” shoppers and winter edits.
  - Goth-Grunge Core:
    - Gray-scale matte palettes (anticipate Blend Bunny Haunt Me demand), deep burgundy singles, and a true “sparkly black” topper.
  - Lips:
    - Cranberry/burgundy glosses and neutral taupe glosses with green/blue reflects.
    - Cool-toned greige/lilac lipsticks and deep brown liners (BBB’s Void/Shadow signal demand on deeper skin).
  - Base/Complexion:
    - TIRTIR AI Cushion (textured-skin win); offer side-by-side testers and finish explainers.
  - Highlighters/Body:
    - Blue/pink iridescent highlighters; shimmering body glow oils/gels for holiday looks.
- Content Strategy:
  - Short reels that show shade flips in different lighting; macro swatches on varied skintones (deep + fair) drive comments and conversions.
  - “Single shadow transformation” and “row-by-row reveal” formats convert; lip-swatch reels show shade range utility.
  - Compare/contrast pieces (e.g., cushion foundations; topper vs shimmer) and “how to make flakes stick” micro-tutorials.
- Gap Analysis:
  - Inclusive liners: expand deep brown/nude liner range; call out “multi-tonal lips” considerations in copy.
  - US availability gaps (UD Headliner): stock comparable icy blue toppers/highlighters.
  - Frequent OOS toppers (It’s Literally Magic): carry alternates and offer notification sign-ups + dupes/edits.
  - Eye safety/technique education around chunky glitters and pressed flakes.

## 6. Special insights

- Emerging Micro-Trends:
  - Grayscale holiday palettes (cool greys + silvery shimmers) as an alt to classic red/green.
  - Lower-lash “glitter drift” and cheekward sparkle as a signature winter finish.
  - Eye gloss renaissance (Rituel de Fille Cygnus) embraced as intentional crease-y, lived-in shine.
- Unexpected Pairings:
  - Lip products as contour (MOB m148), suspended sparkle balms as cheek/inner-corner toppers.
  - Blue waterlines with green/teal lids; orange shadow with icy mint (Nocturnal Flame).
- Creative insight:
  - Package the season into two shoppable edits:
    - “Crystal Ices”: icy toppers, blue/lilac highlighters, pastel mattes, and chrome glosses (+ glitter glue).
    - “Goth Holiday”: gray-scale mattes, sparkly black, burgundy lips, and cool greige/lilac lipsticks.
  - Add “lighting tests” to PDPs (daylight vs warm indoor) to show flip intensity; include “tacky base required” flags per shade.
  - Amplify creator DEI signals: highlight BBB’s immediate shade-extension response as a benchmark; emphasize inclusive lip-liner depth in merchandising.

Notes on audience voice:
- Direct quotes indicating demand: “Just ordered the palette,” “Got them all,” “I need this palette so bad,” “Adding to cart,” “PREORDER.”
- Friction points: “they are always sold out,” “wish they’d make it for the US,” extended processing windows acknowledged but tolerated for special sparkle items.

Overall, winter 2025 is about cold sparkle layered over moody matte structure, with shoppers actively buying when they see flips, flakes, and inclusive shade ranges demonstrated in real time.
