# Weekly Instagram Beauty Media Landscape Report

*   **Key Takeaway:** For the week of November 17 - November 23, 2025, the indie beauty landscape was dominated by major new collection launches, particularly Fantasy Cosmetica's 'Artificer' and Terra Moons' 'Night of the Leonids'. These releases fueled a strong visual trend towards high-impact, multi-dimensional shimmers, while a parallel grunge aesthetic surged through cool-toned, vampy lip combinations.

## 1. Overview

*   **The Vibe:** The feed was electric with "newness." The week was heavily focused on product discovery, driven by coordinated launches from key indie players. Content was primarily swatch-focused, with creators dedicating entire carousels and reels to showcasing the texture and shifts of new eyeshadows. Unboxings, first impressions, and detailed flatlays took precedence over lifestyle content.

*   **Engagement Temperature:** Audience sentiment was overwhelmingly positive and product-centric. Comments were less about the creator and more about the makeup, filled with specific questions about shades ("Neowise, celestine dust, & tempel are STUNNERS 😍"), performance, and launch dates. There was a palpable sense of anticipation and excitement around the new collections.

## 2. Product Momentum (Brand & Item Velocity)

*   **Top Mentioned Brands:**
    *   **Fantasy Cosmetica:** The undisputed leader this week, with its 'Artificer' collection featured by at least six key influencers.
    *   **Terra Moons Cosmetics:** Generated significant buzz with its 'Night of the Leonids' single shadow collection.
    *   **Melt Cosmetics:** The 'Edward Scissorhands' collaboration drove multiple detailed looks and unboxings.
    *   **Rituel de Fille:** Gained traction with the reveal of its Black Friday exclusive 'Hemlock' Lip Sheer.
    *   **Blend Bunny Cosmetics:** Maintained steady presence through creator tutorials and Black Friday sale recommendations.

*   **Viral Products:**
    *   **Fantasy Cosmetica 'Artificer' Palette:** Appeared in numerous flatlays, swatch videos, and eye looks. The cohesive warm-metallic and industrial theme resonated strongly.
    *   **Terra Moons 'Night of the Leonids' Singles:** This 14-piece collection drove significant swatch content. Shades like the emerald green **'Ecliptica'** and the grungy purple-green **'Neowise'** were repeatedly highlighted.
    *   **KIKO Milano Lip Liner '36 Cold Brown':** A single, passionate video by Courtney Quarantine about her year-long search for this "perfect" cool-toned brown liner created a significant signal of a cult-favorite product driven by scarcity.
    *   **Rituel de Fille 'Hemlock' Lip Sheer:** This new blackened-purple sheer lipstick was featured by multiple creators, generating buzz for the brand's upcoming sale and signaling a demand for vampy, comfortable lip formulas.

*   **The "Look" Breakdown:**
    *   **EYES:** The focus was on texture and dimension. Lids were dominated by high-impact, often chunky, multi-chrome and glitter toppers from the new indie collections. There was a clear trend of layering these special shades over a simple matte base to let the sparkle be the hero.
    *   **LIPS:** A strong dichotomy was observed. One camp favored deep, vampy, and often cool-toned lips (Gucci's green lipstick, Rituel de Fille's 'Hemlock'). The other embraced grunge-inspired combos, specifically using black or cool-brown liners to create a '90s ombré effect, often topped with a clear or subtly tinted gloss.
    *   **CHEEKS:** Blush was present but not the main story. Soft pinks were the most common, used to add a flush without competing with the bold eye or lip looks.

## 3. Aesthetic & Hashtag Trends

*   **Visual Themes:**
    *   **#gothmakeup & #grungemakeup:** This was the dominant aesthetic, characterized by deep, moody lip colors, cool-toned eyeshadows, and an overall alternative style. Creators like `s.andromedae` and `courtneyquarantine` championed this theme.
    *   **#sparklymakeup & #etherealmakeup:** This trend was fueled directly by the product launches. Close-up videos and images focused on capturing the intense sparkle and color shifts of new multichrome eyeshadows, creating a magical, high-fantasy visual narrative.
    *   **Industrial Fantasy:** A specific sub-theme emerging from the Fantasy Cosmetica 'Artificer' launch, pairing warm coppers, golds, and bronzes with mechanical-themed props like wrenches and screws in flatlays.

*   **Color Stories:**
    *   **Grungy Jewel Tones:** Deep emeralds, blackened purples with teal shifts, and rich cranberries were the standout shades from the Terra Moons collection.
    *   **Cool-Toned Browns & Greys:** A clear '90s revival, seen in lip liners (`KIKO 'Cold Brown'`), eyeshadows (`Melt x Edward Scissorhands`), and even lip products (MOB Beauty's blue balm used to cool down other shades).
    *   **Pastel Accents:** In contrast to the darker trends, creators like `linsmakeuplooks` consistently used pastel pinks and blues as strategic highlights on the inner corner and brow bone to brighten neutral looks.

## 4. Purchase-Intent Signals (From Comments)

*   **"Add to Cart" Energy:**
    *   **Terra Moons:** "I was planning on being done making purchases this year, but I'm not sure if can pass up this collection!!"
    *   **MOB Beauty x Courtney Quarantine:** "i need the whole collection"
    *   **Glisten Cosmetics 'Bliss' Palette:** "Oh my god I fear I need this palette now 😭"

*   **Restock Demands:**
    *   **Boy Smells 'Les' Candle:** A creator's video lamenting the discontinuation of this scent ("please bring it back. I am begging you.") signals a desire for specific, unique fragrances that have been retired.
    *   **KIKO Milano Lip Liner:** The narrative of it being out of stock for over a year implies strong, unmet demand.

*   **Curiosity Clusters:**
    *   **Gucci Green Lipstick:** High interest in finding a more accessible dupe for this unique shade ("I so need a dupe of this colour," "I've been hunting for a dupe of KVD Plan 9").
    *   **Kaleidos Lip Gloss Formula:** Followers asked specific questions about texture and feel ("How is the texture on it? Is it gritty at all?").
    *   **Melt x Edward Scissorhands Palette:** Viewers were keen to know about the formula, particularly the shimmers and pressed glitter, before purchasing.

## 5. Opportunities for the Store

*   **Stocking Recommendations:**
    *   **Curate "Grungy Jewel Tone" Singles:** Based on the Terra Moons hype, prioritize stocking individual multichrome shadows in deep emerald, blackened plum, and rich cranberry.
    *   **Invest in Cool-Toned Lip Liners:** The intense interest in the KIKO 'Cold Brown' liner is a clear market signal. Sourcing unique, hard-to-find cool brown, grey, and taupe lip liners would meet a specific, vocal demand.
    *   **Prioritize Themed Collections:** The success of Fantasy Cosmetica's 'Artificer' and Melt's 'Edward Scissorhands' shows that palettes with a strong, well-executed narrative and aesthetic are performing exceptionally well.
    *   **Stock "Lip Tone Changers":** Products like MOB Beauty's blue balm, which can alter the tone of any lipstick, tap into the desire for customization and fit the grunge aesthetic.

*   **Content Strategy:**
    *   **"Try-On-All" Reels:** Replicate `glamsmitty`'s highly effective format of trying on every shade from a new collection in a single video. This is a powerful sales tool, described by users as "so helpful."
    *   **Low-Light Sparkle Demos:** Showcase glitter and multichrome products in low-light video to demonstrate their true reflect and shift, a format that consistently performs well for texture-focused products.
    *   **"Get The Look" Tutorials:** Break down popular, replicable looks like `linsmakeuplooks`'s signature eye. Content that empowers followers to achieve a look themselves generates high engagement and loyalty.

*   **Gap Analysis:**
    *   There is an unmet need for accessible dupes of unique luxury lip colors, specifically the Gucci green lipstick. An indie brand could easily fill this niche.
    *   The frustration over the discontinued Boy Smells candle points to an opportunity in the beauty-adjacent lifestyle space for complex, non-traditional scents.

## 6. Special insights

*   **Emerging Micro-Trends:**
    *   **The "Inner Crease" Highlight:** `linsmakeuplooks` demonstrated a technique of placing a pastel highlight not just in the inner corner, but tucked into the curve where the eye socket meets the nose. This specific placement is a subtle evolution of the standard inner corner pop.
    *   **Contrasting Lower Lash Line:** The practice of using a completely different, often bright, color on the lower lash line (e.g., lime green against a deep plum eye) is moving from editorial to a more mainstream indie look.

*   **Unexpected Pairings:**
    *   **Eyeshadow as Blush/Highlight:** A follower noted using a purple eyeshadow from the Courtney Quarantine palette as blush. Similarly, `s.andromedae` used a pressed glitter eyeshadow from the Melt palette as a face highlight, demonstrating the versatility customers seek.

*   **Creative insight**
    *   **The "Toolkit" Ecosystem:** Fantasy Cosmetica's launch of a makeup repair and customization toolkit alongside their palette is a significant strategic move. It positions the brand as a partner in creativity and sustainability, not just a product seller, fostering a deeper customer relationship.
    *   **Hyper-Local Narrative:** The Glaminatrix "Merry Chrissy" palette, with shade names like "Thong Snap" and "Servo Run," is a masterclass in using a specific cultural identity (Australian Christmas) to create a unique, humorous, and highly memorable product in a crowded holiday market. This hyper-localization is a powerful differentiator.
