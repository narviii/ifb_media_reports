# Weekly Instagram Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key Takeaway (Nov 17–23, 2025): Indie launch week drove a surge in iridescent/sparkly eye looks and grunge-leaning lips. Fantasy Cosmetica Artificer, Terra Moons Night of the Leonids, and Melt x Edward Scissorhands anchored the feed, while tutorial-style reels and shade-by-shade try-ons captured the highest engagement.

## 1. Overview

- The Vibe:
  - Launch-heavy week with wall-to-wall swatches, try-ons, and “every shade on eye” reels.
  - Low-light sparkle videography and macro shots dominated; creators layered neutral mattes with high-impact toppers for fast glam.
  - Parallel aesthetics: ethereal shimmer (iridescent toppers) vs. alt/grunge (cool-brown liners, blackened purple/green lips).

- Engagement Temperature:
  - Hot. Tutorial reels and practical demos outperformed static photos.
    - Benchmarks: Lindsey’s step-by-step eyeshadow reel (~29k likes/296k plays), Wet n Wild My Melody full-collection demo (~23k likes/237k plays), Gucci green lipstick test (~23k likes/377k plays).
  - Comments showed active purchase planning (codes, shipping, texture questions) and immediate conversion (“Got mine,” “I need this,” “waiting for BF sale”).

  - Terra Moons Night of the Leonids: Multiple swatch reels; comments citing specific shade lust (“Emberfell,” “Neowise,” “Celestine Dust”), “I was done buying this year but…”
  - Kaleidos Moon Arcade/Glossload: Up-close swatches; buyers probing texture (gritty/sticky) and code stacking—conversion friction but high interest.
  - MOB Beauty x Courtney Reverie: Emotional launch story, creators using shades beyond eyes (purple as blush). Lip content (M149 blue balm + Linger gloss) drew “how-to” engagement.
  - Melt x Edward Scissorhands: Unboxings + looks; packaging/formula notes (smoother/brighter shimmers, one shade more pressed-glitter-like) helped preempt returns.
  - Rituel de Fille Hemlock Lip Sheer: Tease as GWP with BF details; heavy save/intent commentary (“I want it so bad”).

- The “Look” Breakdown:
  - Eyes: Neutral-brown scaffolding (Patrick Ta) + high-sparkle toppers (Terra Moons/Glisten/Cloudicos/Dieverune/Clionadh). Techniques: pastel inner-corner draping under brow; extended lid shimmer above crease for bigger eyes; warm–cool mixing (blue + amber inner corner).
  - Lips: Cool-toned brown liners resurging (KIKO 36 Cold Brown chase), black liner corners for subtle ombré, blue balm overlays to cool/shine, blackened purples (Hemlock), metallic comeback (Melt “Ghosted”), sparkly gloss/oil toppers (Fenty, Kaleidos, Cosmic Brushes oil adding blue hue).
  - Cheeks: Baby-pink blushes (Huda pink palette; Wet n Wild My Melody cream blush surprise hit), deeper bronzy/neutral cheek for grunge balance; education on handling high-pigment blush via brush choice/pressure.

## 5. Opportunities for the Store

- Stocking Recommendations:
  - Sparkle toppers/multichromes: Terra-Moons-style jewel tones; iridescent quads/travel palettes (Cloudicos-like); ultra-sparkly singles (Dieverune/Clionadh vibe).
  - Neutral-to-sparkle palettes: Fantasy Cosmetica Artificer (shimmer-forward with workable mattes); Viseart Sireneuse greens; Oden’s Eye icy tones.
  - Grunge lip bar: cool-brown liners, black liners, blue balm, blackened purple/green lip options, metallic lipsticks; pair with non-gritty sparkly glosses.
  - Cheek edit: baby-pink creams and mauve/berry mattes; include tools to control pigment (duo fiber, airy brushes).
  - Accessories/tools: glitter adhesives/“grip” primers, pan-repair/toolkits, maroon/burgundy mascara.

- Content Strategy:
  - Short-form tutorials with clear steps (outer-corner stamp → inner drizzle of pastel → topper), plus “semi vs wet dewy” SPF/primer comparisons.
  - Shade-by-shade try-ons for new collections; macro + lowlight sparkle reels.
  - “How to make pastels work on deep skin” blending tutorials; warm–cool mix demos.
  - Lip-combo shorts (liner + black corners + balm/gloss overlay); include scent/texture callouts to reduce returns.
  - Black Friday clarity: code stacking, bundle discounts, shipping/warehouse notes to reduce friction.

- Gap Analysis:
  - Glitter gels: users dislike overly wet formulas lifting shadow—stock drier gels/pressed glitters + adhesives.
  - Setting powders: clear demand for non-sparkly, micro-fine brightening under-eye powders.
  - Affordable palettes: desire for deeper shades/contrast (drugstore launches lacked depth).
  - Logistics: US-warehouse availability and transparent tariff estimates win carts.

## 6. Special insights

- Emerging Micro-Trends:
  - Sage inner-corner pop against blues; monochrome red lids; mixed-metals eyes (warm lids + cool detail).
  - Cool-brown liner mania (KIKO 36 Cold Brown shout)—expect sustained demand and dupes.
  - Blue-shift lip toppers (oils/gloss) over matte bases; maroon/burgundy mascara accents.

- Unexpected Pairings:
  - Eyeshadow-as-blush (MOB purple); highlighters on Cupid’s bow for blue gleam; black lip-liner corners for micro-ombré; duochrome highlighters as lid shades.

- Creative insight:
  - “Lowlight sparkle” is the new swatch language—build a dedicated content pipeline (dim light reels + macro transitions).
  - “Wet vs semi-dewy” skin prep comparison content maps neatly to winter dryness concerns—bundle glow primers/SPF with hydrating bases.
  - Storytelling sells: tie palettes to place/time (Aussie Christmas, DnD Artificer, film-collab nostalgia). Curate capsules by mood—Nostalgia Warm Sparkle, Icy Siren, Grunge Romance.
