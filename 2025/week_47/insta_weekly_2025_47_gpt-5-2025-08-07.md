# Weekly Instagram Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key Takeaway: 17–23 Nov 2025 leaned maximalist and sparkly: indie duochromes and glitter toppers drove the feed (Fantasy Cosmetica Artificer, Terra Moons Night of the Leonids), while grunge-leaning lip combos and glossy, iridescent lips spiked engagement. Tutorial-style reels and full-collection try-ons outperformed static shots.

## 1. Overview

- The Vibe:
  - Heavy on live swatches, try-ons, and quick tutorials showcasing multichrome/iridescent textures; multiple brand launch weeks overlapped.
  - Reels mixed technique education (placement, brush pressure, base selection) with shade-by-shade try-ons across entire collections.
  - Aesthetic split: ethereal toppers in cool light vs moody grunge glam (blackened greens, cranberry shimmers, vampy lips).

- Engagement Temperature:
  - Warm-to-hot. Comments included “I need this”/“AHH I WANT,” restock queries, shipping/tariff questions, and texture concerns (stickiness/grit, wet glitter gels).

## 6. Special insights

- Emerging Micro-Trends:
  - Glitter saturation beyond the lid—down the lower lash line and up toward the brow; star-shaped glitter accents.
  - Chartreuse detail as a transformer shade (inner corner/waterline) against cool-toned glitter smoke.
  - Mixed metals eye looks (warm gold base + cool iridescent topper) appearing in multiple creators.

- Unexpected Pairings:
  - Palette shades used as blush (MOB x CQ purple as blush); lip oil over matte liquid lipstick for a blue-cast grunge lip; “blue balm” layered over mauves to cool and amplify shine.
  - SPF/dewy preps under medium-coverage foundation with visible glow difference (Fwee semi vs wet).

- Creative insight:
  - “Pastel emo” is crystallizing: coquette pink structure + grunge under-eye and black liner edges, sold through relatable, fast GRWMs. Pair this with low-light sparkle showcasing and you have the week’s winning content formula.
  - Nails as supporting aesthetic: copper chrome press-ons echo the mixed-metal eye trend—cross-merchandising opportunity with metallic nails beside glitter shadows and lip toppers.
