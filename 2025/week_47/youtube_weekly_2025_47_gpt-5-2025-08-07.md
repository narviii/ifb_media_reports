# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key takeaway: For the week of Nov 17–23, 2025, indie color launches and Black Friday urgency dominated. Melt’s Edward Scissorhands, Fantasy Cosmetica’s Artificer, and Oden’s Eye Ice Crystal drew concentrated, high-intent attention, while creators pushed grungy-cool winter looks, heavy shimmer textures, and tool-driven customization.

## 1. Overview

- The week felt like peak pre–Black Friday: dense affiliate code usage, deal stacking guidance, and “buy-now” language around limited collabs and first waves of holiday drops. Creators balanced excitement with a visible “low-buy/only-if-you-love-it” stance.
- Eyes ruled: creators leaned into cool-toned, winter-icy palettes and grungy greens/purples/blue steel, with “alternative holiday” aesthetics (goth, vamp, spooky-winter) outperforming classic red/gold cheer.
- Texture talk was relentless—metallics, multichromes, pressed glitters, glossy “wet” shimmers—plus layered blush and lip “cocktails.” Metallic black and high-shine inner corners reappeared as hero moves.
- Utility and customization entered the spotlight: Fantasy Cosmetica’s pan remover and repress kit, empty magnetic palettes, and the broader “singles are back” narrative signaled collector/hobbyist needs.
- Influencer skepticism showed up in two forms: pushback on a celebrity toddler skincare brand (ethical concerns) and critique of brands launching expensive collabs without adequate swatches—elevating the value of creator-led swatch content.
- Complexion commentary skewed practical: lightweight/serum, non-creasing concealers and mattifying-but-skin-like powders are praised; heavy, greasy, or cakey bases are discarded.

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

- Top indie SKUs with momentum
  - Melt Cosmetics Edward Scissorhands collection (palette; pastel waterline eyeliners; accessory SKUs). Sentiment: strongly positive. Context: collectible IP, “best shimmers Melt has done,” cohesive cool-toned winter story; one blush shade too light (mixed).
  - Fantasy Cosmetica Artificer collection (9-pan palette; holographic singles; pan remover; repress kit; empty magnetic palette). Sentiment: positive (one split-pan shimmer “Infusion” noted as drier—best applied damp). Context: warm/neutral “spicy” metals with complex shimmers; tools seen as genuinely innovative; heavy pre-launch swatch hype and stacked codes.
  - Oden’s Eye Ice Crystal palette + Star Legend Highlighter. Sentiment: positive. Context: high-sparkle, iridescent, winter-themed; multiple creators showcasing sunlight sparkle and full-arm swatches; available-now messaging plus Black Friday stackability.
  - Bella Beauté Bar Come Play With Us. Sentiment: positive. Context: “spooky holiday”—icy blues with classic holiday brights; high pigment in mattes and shifting shimmers.
  - Klarity Kosmetics The Other Side. Sentiment: positive, low-stock noted earlier; “grungy, moody jewel tones.”
  - Simply Posh Gingerbread Bakery. Sentiment: positive; half-neutral/half-pastel utility, glossy shimmers; ranks lower only due to creator color preferences, not quality.
  - ColourPop Grinch palette. Sentiment: positive visuals; ranked lowest among 10 due to stronger formulas elsewhere—still “fun,” collectible, good mattes/shimmers for the price.
  - Mooncat x Avatar nail lacquers. Sentiment: very positive. Context: fandom-driven, shimmers/multichromes; collectibility front and center.

- Cross-creator patterns
  - “Lots of creators testing” Artificer and Edward Scissorhands with repeated affiliate codes and urgent launch timing.
  - Melt Edward Scissorhands became the week’s default comparison/collectible anchor for cool-toned holiday looks; creators swatched on tattooed skin to prove payoff.
  - Repeat praise for maximal shimmer impact; pressed glitters and wet metallics positioned as the holiday “finish.”
  - Repeat criticism: one Melt blush too light; ColourPop quality variance acknowledged; a single Artificer shimmer requires damp/finger.

- Product combos tested
  - Blush stacking: Glaminatrix Soft Liquid Blush + Kaleidos Dreamwalk; Melt Daydreamer Cream + Unearthly Mystic.
  - Lip layering: Unearthly liners + Dose of Colors/Black Moon metallics/Half Magic gloss; Melt Cinnamon liner + Half Magic gloss. The liner+gloss or liner+metallic liquid formula is the season’s default.
  - Eye shimmer layering: liquid chameleon base + multichrome single over deep matte greens; frequent inner-corner brighteners; metallic black as a lid anchor.

## 3. Category Trends

- Momentum categories
  - Eyeshadow palettes: cool-toned winter stories (blues/purples/silvers), grungy greens/charcoals, and “spicy metallic” neutrals. Multichrome/duochrome/marbled shimmers are the hook.
  - Eye accessories: pastel waterline pencils (Melt) and colored eyeliners (Kaleidos) get “must-buy” reactions.
  - Single shadows + magnetic systems: renewed interest in building custom palettes; tools (pan remover/repress kits) signal a collector-care niche.
  - Cheeks: blush layering (cream + powder) for saturation and wear.
  - Lips: defined liner bases topped with high-shine gloss or metallic liquids; vampy/alt reds and plums show up alongside nude glosses.
  - Nails: collab, shimmery lacquers as giftable, fandom-friendly add-ons.

- Aesthetics/textures
  - Alternative holiday/grunge winter; high-shine toppers; icy duochromes; metallic black; bright inner-corner sparks.
  - Strategic placement: neutral lids with color on lower lash; reverse smoky inner corners; glitter focused on lid center.

- Fatigue/skepticism
  - Declutter content flags frustration with heavy/greasy bases; preference for lightweight, crease-resistant, and blurring powders.
  - Skepticism toward celebrity/gimmick launches (kids’ skincare) and poor brand swatch transparency on high-ticket collabs.

- Seasonal shift
  - Clear pivot to winter palettes, icy sparkle, and collector packaging; deep greens/reds coexist with frosty blues/purples.

## 4. Emerging Themes & Narratives

- High-impact shimmer and multichrome dominance
  - Multiple creators centered looks and swatches on reflective, shifting finishes; “wet look” shimmers are a purchase driver.

- IP/nostalgia collaborations as conversion engines
  - Melt x Edward Scissorhands and ColourPop Grinch drove seasonal, collectible demand; Mooncat x Avatar nails extend the model beyond makeup.

- Cool-toned and grungy winter palettes resurge
  - Cool blues/purples/silvers with grungy greens/charcoal recur across creators and brands.

- Customization and maintenance tools
  - Depanning, repress kits, empty magnetic palettes, and single shadows show a collector/DIY cycle returning; creators call out utility as “really cool.”

- Affiliate-code stacking + extended Black Friday windows
  - Indie brands lean on creator codes and longer promo windows; creators guide viewers on stacking and exclusions, reinforcing indie advantage vs. mainstream.

- Creator skepticism toward brand practices
  - Two vectors: ethical critique of toddler skincare commercialization and frustration over insufficient brand swatch imagery for pricey collabs—raising the bar for product information.

- Regional/brand-origin momentum
  - Western indie: Melt, Fantasy Cosmetica, Nomad, Bella Beauté Bar, Simply Posh, Dede’s Signature—high visibility and positive sentiment.
  - Nordic/European indie: Oden’s Eye (Sweden) strong; UK (Cosmic Brushes, ArtTitude) visible with launches/restocks.
  - C-beauty adjacent: Kaleidos re-enters with Moon Arcade (eyeliners, lip systems), welcomed by creators.

## 5. Purchase-Intent Signals

- Strongest “I’d buy this” clusters
  - Melt Edward Scissorhands palette and pastel waterline pencils: “best shimmers,” repeated looks, collector packaging; multiple creators featuring, ranking it top.

  - Oden’s Eye Ice Crystal: “available now” + code stack; sunlight sparkle demos by multiple creators.

- Additional converters
  - Blush layering SKUs (Glaminatrix, Kaleidos, Melt, Unearthly): visible impact and technique-led reasoning (longevity, saturation).

  - Singles/magnetic systems and tools: pan remover/repress kit + empty palettes position the store as a “collector support” hub.
  - Black Friday urgency: brands with 40–60%+ and code stacking (Gourmande Girls, Clionadh, Fantasy Cosmetica categories) prompt immediate action.

- Cooling signals
  - Bulky packaging (Glamlite Bratz) dampens interest despite theme.
  - Heavy/greasy or cakey bases receive negative/declutter outcomes, reducing appetite for that complexion profile.
