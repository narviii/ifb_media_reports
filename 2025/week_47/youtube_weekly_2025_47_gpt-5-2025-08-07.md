# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key takeaway: For the week of 2025-11-17 to 2025-11-23, indie color launches and Black Friday playbooks dominated creator content. Cool-toned “grungy winter” looks, multichrome shimmer payoffs, and code-stacked indie sales drove the strongest purchase intent.

## 1. Overview

This week felt like a concentrated pre–Black Friday push from indie color brands paired with creator-led shopping guidance. Multiple creators ran sale roundups and “how to shop” content, while still delivering high-impact looks that demonstrate why these items are worth buying.

Texture talk was front-and-center: creators showcased wet-look metallics, duochromes/multichromes, pressed glitters, and “metallic blacks,” using glitter primers and damp-brush techniques to maximize payoff and minimize fallout. Eyeshadow remained the hero category, with palettes used as storytelling anchors for seasonal looks rather than daily-utility claims.

Aesthetically, there was clear migration to cool, icy, and grunge-leaning winter stories (blues, purples, silvers, greens), with licensed nostalgia fueling momentum (Melt x Edward Scissorhands, ColourPop x Grinch; Mooncat x Avatar on nails). Lip and cheek content pivoted toward layering—deep liners under metallic/juicy glosses and cream-plus-powder blush stacks.

Complexion discourse showed fatigue with heavy bases and renewed preference for lightweight/serum textures and non-creasing concealers. There was also visible consumer skepticism toward marketing excess (celebrity kid skincare), and toward poor brand-side information (lack of official swatches), increasing reliance on creator swatches.

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

Top mentioned indie launches and drivers:
- Fantasy Cosmetica Artificer (palette + tools)
  - Sentiment: strong positive across creators; one shimmer noted “drier” but workable wet (mixed on that single shade).
  - Context: warm/neutral “spicy” color story with complex shimmers; innovative Pan Remover + Repress Kit resonated with collectors (customization, repair).
  - Hype cycle: pre-launch teasers → launch-week swatches/looks → sale mechanics (code stacking).
- Melt Cosmetics x Edward Scissorhands palette (+ accessories)
  - Sentiment: highly positive; “some of Melt’s best shimmers,” collectible packaging; one shade flagged as pressed-glitter-like, not a dealbreaker.
  - Context: compact, cool-toned grunge winter; creators criticized Melt’s lack of site swatches, underscoring the need for strong retailer imagery.
- Oden’s Eye Ice Crystal palette
  - Sentiment: positive; dazzling, icy shimmers showcased in sunlight; “available now” urgency; stacked code messaging.
  - Context: winter-themed, high-shine and multichrome appeal; creators already showing pan preference patterns.
- Bella Beauté Bar Come Play With Us
  - Sentiment: positive; “so pigmented” reds; shimmer needs damp brush—technique-forward guidance increases success rates for buyers.
- Klarity Kosmetics The Other Side
  - Sentiment: positive; moody, jewel-toned shimmers—called out as a favorite look; low-stock mentions imply scarcity-driven demand.
- Simply Posh Gingerbread Bakery
  - Sentiment: positive for quality; lower rank due to pastel/neutral color story preference mismatch for some creators.
- ColourPop x Grinch palette
  - Sentiment: positive tutorial outcomes; positioned as “alt holiday” smoky looks; recognized brand inconsistency noted, but this collab delivers.
- Single/shimmer standouts and toppers
  - Fantasy Cosmetica Adamantine singles; Menagerie Adelie topper; Oden’s Eye Star Legend Highlighter; SINGE-ON chameleon liquids—high-impact, easy-to-viralize effects.

Notable tools and accessories:
- Fantasy Cosmetica Pan Remover + Repress Kit: “really cool idea” with clear collector utility.
- Glitter/adhesive primers (Clionadh Shine On; unspecified “SHINE-ON”): key to successful shimmer/glitter wear.
- Pastel waterline liners (Melt Slick Waterline pastels): “must-buy” enthusiasm.

Repeat criticism clusters:
- Poor brand product imagery (Melt’s site lacking swatches) → creators filling the gap.
- Bulky packaging (Glamlite Bratz) dampens purchase despite shade interest.
- Celebrity “kid skincare” (Rini) met with strong ethical pushback (not a buy-driver).

Common product combos creators used:
- Deep liner + gloss: Unearthly Reap + Black Moon Immortal (metallic); Melt Cinnamon + Half Magic Frosty B*tch Gloss.
- Bold red lip: Unearthly Bad Blood + Dose of Colors Extra Saucy.
- Blush stacking: Glaminatrix Soft Liquid Blush + Kaleidos Dreamwalk (bright, “doll-like”); Melt Cream Blush + Unearthly Mystic Blush.
- Shimmer layering: Liquid chameleon base + multichrome single (SINGE-ON + Fantasy Cosmetica Adamantine).

## 3. Category Trends

- Eyeshadow palettes: Peak momentum; cool-toned, grungy winter stories (blues/purples/silvers/greens) with multichromes/pressed glitters driving looks. Metallic black cited as a “10/10” impact shade.
- Shimmers/multichromes: The texture of the week. Finger or damp-brush application and glitter primers are normalized techniques.
- Eyeliners: Pastel waterline pencils (lavender/green) as accent staples; graphic liner and lower-lash pops for seasonal contrast.
- Lips: Layered lip “cocktails”—deep liners under metallic or high-shine glosses; vampy/alt shades for holiday looks.
- Cheeks: Cream + powder blush stacking to intensify saturation and wear; bright pinks and berry tones for seasonal flush.
- Complexion: Preference for lightweight, serum-like tints and non-creasing concealers; declutters highlight rejection of heavy/cakey finishes.
- Nails: Licensed IP lacquer collections (Mooncat x Avatar) show crossover fandom demand for high-shimmer specialty finishes.

Seasonal shift signals:
- “Grungy winter” and “icy” aesthetics dominate holiday looks over traditional warm gold/red glamour.
- More body/hair sparkle (glitter sprays) vs face use—party-season utility.

## 6. Opportunities for the Store

Stocking priorities (high momentum, high intent):
- Cool-toned, grungy winter palettes with standout shimmers:
  - If accessible: Oden’s Eye Ice Crystal; Klarity The Other Side; Bella Beauté Bar Come Play With Us; Simply Posh Gingerbread Bakery (as alt holiday).
  - If not, curate equivalents: compact cool-toned palettes with metallic blacks, icy silvers, violet/teal shimmers.
- Multichrome singles and toppers:
  - Fantasy Cosmetica Adamantine–like singles; Clionadh-style stained glass shades; liquid chameleon toppers; pair them with glitter primers.
- Pastel waterline eyeliners:
  - If Melt unavailable, offer indie alternatives (creamy, long-wearing lavenders/greens) and market them as “winter brighteners.”
- Blush layering duo kits:
  - Bundle cream + powder blush in coordinated shades (e.g., deep base + bright pink topper) and market as “cold-flush” sets.
- Lip combo kits:
  - Deep/vampy liners paired with metallic or high-shine gloss; offer curated “creator-inspired” combos (e.g., plum liner + metallic liquid lip).

Merchandising and content:
- Technique-first PDPs: Include damp-brush guidance, glitter primer recommendations, and “seen on creators” shade recipes to reduce return risk.
- Swatch depth: Provide arm swatches across tones, including on tattooed/medium-to-deep skin; fix the “brand imagery gap” creators flagged.
- Customization hub:
  - Stock empty magnetic palettes, pan remover/repress tools, magnets; create a “Depan & Customize” category for the collector audience.
- Seasonal edits:
  - “Grungy Winter” and “Icy Holiday” storefronts; cross-sell pastel liners, glitter primers, and vampy lip kits.

Promotions and timing:
- Mirror indie code-stacking logic where possible (tiered cart discounts + code).
- Pre-Black Friday microdrops or “early access” for email/SMS subscribers reflect current creator timelines.
- Scarcity signaling: If SKUs are limited, communicate “low stock” truthfully—creators respond to transparent scarcity.

Areas to deprioritize or caution:
- Heavy, cakey foundations and over-glowy “grease” finishes—creators are decluttering these.
- Bulky palette packaging—called out as a downside even when shades appeal.
- Glitter setting sprays for face—position for body/hair to match creator usage.

Identified gaps to fill:
- Reliable pastel waterline pencils (creamy, set-down formulas).
- Metallic black eyeshadows with high reflect (few direct options; strong interest signaled).
- Comprehensive glitter/shimmer starter bundles (primer + 2–3 shades + brush).
- High-quality depanning/repress tools and replacement magnets (underserved but high utility for indie collectors).

Overall: Double down on high-impact eye textures, creator-validated techniques, and flexible shopping mechanics. Lean into winter grunge, bundle the combos creators are teaching, and fix brand-side imagery gaps to convert Black Friday discovery into sustained repeat sales.
