# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

For the week of November 17-23, 2025, the indie makeup sector dominated creator conversations, driven by highly anticipated themed eyeshadow palette releases and a strategic focus on navigating Black Friday sales, which have effectively started.

## 1. Overview

This week was characterized by a surge of excitement around new, thematic indie eyeshadow palettes, particularly from Fantasy Cosmetica and Melt Cosmetics. Creators dedicated significant content to unboxings, multi-look tutorials, and rankings, signaling strong initial reception and high-quality formulas, especially in shimmer and multichrome finishes. The "grungy winter" and "spicy neutral" aesthetics were prominent, moving away from softer looks.

Concurrent with these launches, the narrative shifted decisively toward Black Friday. Senior creators like Angelica Nyqvist and Rachel Palmieri released comprehensive guides to indie brand sales, positioning themselves as trusted curators for their audiences. This content emphasized strategic purchasing, the value of stacking affiliate codes, and conscious consumerism, highlighting a mature relationship between creators and viewers.

There was also a notable undercurrent of cynicism toward mainstream celebrity ventures, with a detailed critique of a new toddler skincare line serving as a counterpoint to the passion-driven projects seen in the indie space. Overall, the week felt like a strategic ramp-up to the holiday shopping season, with creators acting as key guides for navigating new releases and maximizing value from indie brands.

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

-   **Fantasy Cosmetica Artificer Palette:** This was the most discussed product of the week, featured by Angelica Nyqvist, Rachel Palmieri, and battybean across multiple videos (reveals, tutorials, rankings). Sentiment was unanimously positive. Creators praised its "steampunky spicy neutral" color story, the versatility of its blendable mattes, and the exceptional quality of its complex, metallic shimmers. The accompanying toolkit (pan remover, repress kit) was highlighted as an innovative value-add for makeup collectors. Multiple creators promoted their affiliate codes, indicating strong purchase intent.

-   **Melt Cosmetics Edward Scissorhands Palette:** Generated significant buzz with features from battybean and a full-collection review from Heather Austin. The palette was lauded for its "grungy winter dream" aesthetic, cool-toned color story (blues, purples), and collectible packaging. The shimmer formula was repeatedly singled out as "some of the best Melt has ever done." It ranked #1 in battybean's "last 10 palettes" video, a powerful endorsement.

-   **Oden's Eye Ice Crystal Palette:** Featured in reveals by Angelica Nyqvist and Heather Austin, and ranked highly by battybean. The "iridescent wintery vibes" and unique mix of icy tones with pops of warmth were well-received, positioning it as a strong holiday contender.

-   **Klarity Kosmetics The Other Side Palette:** Though not a new release, it was highlighted by battybean as her favorite look in a multi-palette video, praised for its "moody, whimsical, dark garden" theme and rich jewel tones. Mention of low stock could create urgency.

-   **Lip & Blush Combos:** Creator battybean produced a series of short-form videos demonstrating specific product pairings ("lip combo," "blush combo"). This format consistently featured indie brands like Unearthly Cosmetics, Melt Cosmetics, Glaminatrix, and Kaleidos, signaling a trend toward layering different formulas (cream + powder, liner + gloss) for customized finishes.

## 3. Category Trends

-   **Eyeshadow Palettes:** This category overwhelmingly dominated the landscape. The focus was on highly thematic, collectible palettes from indie brands. Color stories leaned dramatic and seasonal—cool-toned wintery grunge (Melt), warm artisan neutrals (Fantasy Cosmetica), and spooky holiday (Bella Beaute Bar).

-   **High-Impact Shimmers & Multichromes:** This was the key purchasing driver within eyeshadow palettes. Creators consistently dedicated screen time to swatching and applying complex, shifty, and metallic shades. A palette's value was often judged by the quality and uniqueness of its shimmers.

-   **Blush:** The "blush combo" or layering trend (liquid/cream base with a powder topper) gained visibility through short-form content. This suggests a move toward more advanced application techniques for achieving vibrancy and longevity. Brands like Glaminatrix (liquid) and Kaleidos (powder) were featured.

-   **Complexion:** A major declutter video from Angelica Nyqvist provided insight into long-term performance. The trend favors lightweight, serum-like formulas that provide coverage without looking heavy or creasing. Drugstore standouts (Maybelline Lumi Matte, Maybelline Super Stay Concealer) were praised for outperforming high-end counterparts.

## 4. Emerging Themes & Narratives

-   **Indie Brands as Black Friday Destination:** A strong, cross-creator narrative emerged positioning indie brands as the primary focus for Black Friday shopping. Creators provided detailed guides on sales, discount codes, and—most importantly—which affiliate codes could be "stacked" for maximum savings. This empowers consumers and solidifies the creator's role as a strategic shopping partner.

-   **Themed Collections Drive Hype:** The most successful launches of the week were tied to strong, cohesive themes (Melt's *Edward Scissorhands*, Fantasy Cosmetica's *Artificer*). This indicates that narrative, packaging, and a unique point of view are as important as the product formula itself in the indie space.

-   **Critique of Mainstream "Cash Grabs":** Angelica Nyqvist's critique of the Rini toddler skincare line served as a strong counter-narrative. It framed the venture as a cynical, market-driven response to a trend ("Sephora Kids") rather than a product filling a genuine need. This reinforces the perception of indie brands as more authentic and passion-driven.

-   **Return of Customization:** The launch of LH Cosmetics' single magnetic eyeshadows and Fantasy Cosmetica's toolkit for de-panning and re-pressing signals a renewed interest in customizable palettes and makeup maintenance, catering to the enthusiast and collector communities.

## 5. Purchase-Intent Signals

-   **Affiliate Code Stacking:** The repeated emphasis on stacking affiliate codes with Black Friday sales is a powerful purchase driver. Creators are explicitly telling audiences how to get the deepest possible discount, lowering the barrier to purchase for high-interest items.

-   **Ranking Videos as Endorsements:** battybean's "Ranking My Last 10 Palettes" video functions as a direct guide. Placing the Melt *Edward Scissorhands* palette at #1 and ArtTitude *Submerged* at #3 sends a clear signal of which products are "worth it" from a trusted source.

-   **"Best Formula Ever" Claims:** Statements like battybean calling the Melt shimmers "some of the best Melt Cosmetics has ever done" or Angelica Nyqvist calling Nabla's Cupid's Arrow "some of the best eye pens in the game" are strong triggers that imply superior performance and value.

-   **Urgency Through Scarcity:** Mentions of low stock (Klarity Kosmetics) or "last chance" items (Oden's Eye OG Hela palette) create urgency for immediate purchase.

## 6. Opportunities for the Store

-   **Stock High-Momentum Palettes:** Prioritize stocking the **Fantasy Cosmetica Artificer Palette** and the **Melt Cosmetics Edward Scissorhands Palette**. These had the strongest, most positive, and most widespread creator coverage this week.

-   **Curate Around "Combos":** Market and merchandise products as effective pairs. Create bundles featuring a cream/liquid blush with a complementary powder blush, or a lip liner with a gloss. This aligns with the emerging application trend and can increase basket size. Featured brands in this trend included **Unearthly Cosmetics**, **Melt Cosmetics**, **Glaminatrix**, and **Kaleidos**.

-   **Focus on High-Impact Singles:** The demand for unique shimmers is high. Consider stocking standout single shadows with multichrome or high-impact metallic finishes, as seen with the praise for Fantasy Cosmetica's singles.

-   **Leverage Black Friday Intel:** Use the creator-provided Black Friday guides as a sourcing list. The brands featured (Gourmande Girls, Oden's Eye, Clionadh, etc.) are top-of-mind for engaged indie consumers. Aligning your holiday promotions with these brands could capture existing demand.

-   **Avoid Complexion Overload:** The declutter video revealed a clear preference for specific, high-performing complexion products and fatigue with mediocre formulas, regardless of price. Be highly selective with foundation and concealer SKUs, focusing on lightweight, serum-like textures that have proven performance. The **Maybelline Lumi Matte Foundation** is a drugstore product with high-end performance signals.
