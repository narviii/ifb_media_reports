# Weekly Instagram Beauty Media Landscape Report

*   **Key Takeaway:** For the week ending December 14, 2025, the indie beauty landscape was electrified by the launch of the Terra Moons x Ellie Starr "Aurora Chasing" palette, driving a dominant trend of cool-toned, high-sparkle celestial looks. This was contrasted by a strong undercurrent of #softgrunge and #gothmakeup aesthetics, featuring bold, dark lips and smoky, colorful eyes.

## 1. Overview

*   **The Vibe:** The week was heavily launch-focused, dominated by unboxings, live swatches, and tutorials for new collections. The energy was palpable around influencer collaborations, particularly the Terra Moons x Ellie Starr release, which felt like a community-wide event. Video content, especially detailed swatch reels and application tutorials, far outweighed static images in driving conversation.

*   **Engagement Temperature:** Follower engagement was high and specific. Comments moved beyond simple compliments to direct questions about product performance ("Do these shimmers crease?"), application techniques ("Could you show how you do colored brows?"), and explicit purchase declarations. There was a clear sense of excitement and trust in creator recommendations for new launches.

## 2. Product Momentum (Brand & Item Velocity)

*   **Top Mentioned Brands:**
    *   **Terra Moons Cosmetics:** Unquestionably the brand of the week due to their collaboration with Ellie Starr.
    *   **Blend Bunny Cosmetics:** Generated significant buzz with the "Haunt Me" palette and its accompanying lip collection.
    *   **Glisten Cosmetics:** Consistently featured for wet liners and colored mascaras in creative looks.
    *   **Rituel de Fille:** Featured for its unique "soft goth" aesthetic, particularly its eye soots and lip sheers.
    *   **MAC Cosmetics:** Remained relevant with new chrome eyeshadows and classic lip products.

*   **Viral Products:**
    *   **Terra Moons x Ellie Starr "Aurora Chasing" Palette:** This palette was the week's centerpiece, appearing in at least 8 distinct posts from multiple creators. Its vibrant, cool-toned color story and mix of matte and high-impact shimmer formulas were heavily showcased.
    *   **Blend Bunny Cosmetics "Haunt Me" Lip Collection:** The Pro Colored Pencils ("Bloodline," "Rated-R") and Lip Glazes generated strong interest for their versatility (lips and eyes) and intense pigmentation.
    *   **Pat McGrath "VR Sextacy" Eyeshadow:** While not new, this shade was a benchmark for quality, with creators comparing other blue-brown duochromes against it, reaffirming its cult status.
    *   **Sheeneffect Ombré Chrome Shadows:** These C-beauty singles captured attention for their unique gradient effect and intense sparkle, signaling a potential new product trend.

*   **The "Look" Breakdown:**
    *   **EYES:** The focus was on texture and dimension. High-sparkle, wet-look shimmers, and chunky glitters were essential. Cool-toned duochromes (blue-brown, teal-purple) were prevalent. Graphic liner evolved from simple wings to holiday-themed doodles like stockings and snowflakes.
    *   **LIPS:** A tale of two extremes. The grunge aesthetic drove demand for opaque, high-shine black and deep burgundy lip glazes. In contrast, the ethereal trend was supported by sparkly, sheer lip oils and balms.
    *   **CHEEKS:** Highlighters were non-negotiable and intensely sparkly, often with a visible color shift (e.g., Dieverune's "Drop" with a blue-purple shift). Blush was applied with a heavy hand, often in cool pinks to complement the eye looks.

## 3. Aesthetic & Hashtag Trends

*   **Visual Themes:** The feed was a blend of celestial and subversive aesthetics. **#etherealmakeup** and **#sparklymakeup** were driven by the aurora-themed launches, while **#gothmakeup**, **#altmakeup**, and **#softgrunge** defined the cooler, moodier looks. Holiday makeup (#christmasmakeup) manifested as playful graphic art rather than traditional red-and-gold glam.
*   **Color Stories:** Cool tones reigned supreme. Palettes of **deep teals, vibrant magentas, icy blues, and rich purples** were dominant. These were often paired with stark contrasts like black lip liner, white inner corners, or a bold, classic red lip.

## 4. Purchase-Intent Signals (From Comments)

*   **"Add to Cart" Energy:**
    *   **Blend Bunny Lip Liners:** "Never imagined a lip/eye liner would be my first purchase of a brand, but I'm definitely considering these now!" and "I want more shades in that liner formula lol"
    *   **Besame Cosmetics Black Lipstick:** "The fact I'm about to buy this because you're genuinely the only person who I trust with this as a beginner😭🖤"
    *   **Hyrular Beauty Lip Balm:** "😯 OoooOo I NEED that!" and "I need it right now take my money"

*   **Restock Demands:**
    *   **EOS Cocoa Cashmere Lotion:** The limited-edition status of this product caused significant frustration, with comments like "@eosproducts please make this permanent!! I still haven’t been able to get my hands on a big bottle cuz it sells out so fast😭"
    *   **Dieverune Cosmetics "Drop" Highlighter:** Mentioned as being out of stock, with the creator noting the brand is "working on a restock."

*   **Curiosity Clusters:**
    *   **Red Highlighters:** A video on the rarity of red highlighters sparked a community discussion, with followers suggesting alternatives from Kaleidos, Bitter Lace Beauty, and Unearthly Cosmetics, indicating a clear market desire.
    *   **Terra Moons Formula:** A direct question "Do these shimmers crease on you?" shows consumers are interested in performance beyond just the color story.
    *   **Application Techniques:** A request for a "colored brows" tutorial on a look using Glisten Cosmetics products shows audience interest in replicating specific, advanced techniques.

## 5. Opportunities for the Store

*   **Stocking Recommendations:**
    *   Immediately prioritize the **Terra Moons x Ellie Starr "Aurora Chasing" palette** and the accompanying **"TerraStarr" highlighter**.
    *   Expand the single shadow selection with high-impact, cool-toned duochromes and multichromes. Blue-brown, purple-green, and teal shifts are in high demand.
    *   Stock versatile lip/eye pencils in black and burgundy, like the Blend Bunny Pro Colored Pencils.
    *   Offer a curated selection of "Soft Goth" essentials: sheer black lipsticks, taupe cream blushes, and high-shine black lip oils.

*   **Content Strategy:**
    *   **Comparison Swatches:** Content comparing a cult classic (Pat McGrath's VR Sextacy) to indie alternatives performed very well. This format builds credibility and helps customers make informed decisions.
    *   **Tutorial Reels:** Step-by-step tutorials for both complex graphic liner looks and simple one-shadow shimmer applications are highly engaging.
    *   **Texture Focus:** Use macro shots and video to showcase the sparkle, shift, and texture of shimmers and glitters. The "wet look" is a key selling point.

*   **Gap Analysis:** The community-sourced list of red highlighters in the comments of post `DSJuj7nkZIp` reveals a significant market gap. Sourcing and prominently featuring a true, high-quality red highlighter could capture this unmet demand. The frustration over limited edition scents like EOS Cocoa Cashmere presents an opportunity to market permanent gourmand body care as reliable alternatives.

## 6. Special insights

*   **Emerging Micro-Trends:**
    *   **Ombré Single Shadows:** Sheeneffect's new releases were highlighted as a potential new trend in C-beauty, moving beyond a single multichrome to a gradient effect within one pan.
    *   **Contrasting Mascara/Inner Corner:** The pairing of burgundy or maroon mascara with a bright, icy blue inner corner (`DSBkvyHiRoQ`) is a sophisticated way to add color and dimension without a full eyeshadow look.

*   **Unexpected Pairings:**
    *   The concept of using products across categories is being normalized. MOB Beauty's Cream Clay Eyeshadow was demonstrated as a lipstick (`DSOQZyDgXlq`), and the community is actively using iridescent eyeshadows as face highlighters. This multi-use functionality is a strong selling point.

*   **Creative insight**:
    *   **The Sophisticated Curator:** The audience is increasingly acting as curators, not just consumers. They are interested in building custom palettes (Lethal Cosmetics BYOP), understanding nuanced formula differences (Terra Moons' hand-pressed vs. lab-made), and collecting multiple versions of a specific color type (blue-browns). This indicates a mature market that values variety, detailed reviews, and the ability to personalize their collection. Marketing should lean into this by highlighting single shadows and component-based systems.
