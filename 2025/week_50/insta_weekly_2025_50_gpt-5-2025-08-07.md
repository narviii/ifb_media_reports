# Weekly Instagram Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key Takeaway (Dec 8–14, 2025): Sparkle-forward alt-glam dominated: the Terra Moons x Ellie Starr “Aurora Chasing” launch and Blend Bunny’s Haunt Me + Masterclass lips drove the feed, while creators and audiences doubled down on blue-brown duochromes, wet-look highlighters, and gradient wet-liner. High-intent comments clustered around restocks, shade comparisons, and “what creases/what lasts” questions.

## 1. Overview

- The Vibe:
  - Launch week energy with wall-to-wall PR swatches, live try-ons, and side-by-side comparisons.
  - Tutorial-heavy reels mixing holiday doodle liner (stockings, snowflakes, antlers) with icy inner corners and neon-lime glitter lids.
  - Short “on-eye” multichrome demos and lip-combo try-ons outperformed static pans; low‑light swatch passes boosted shimmer credibility.

- Engagement Temperature:
  - Hot. Threads full of “sold,” “ordering,” and “is it restocking?” plus product performance questions (creasing, eye-safe glitter, CF red lips).
  - Lifestyle/charity content (Angel Tree) and comedic GRWMs from Lindsey Rowley pulled the week’s highest reach, reinforcing trust that converted on product posts.

## 6. Special insights

- Emerging Micro-Trends:
  - Ombre multichrome pans (3‑tone stripes in one pan) poised to spread beyond C‑beauty in 2026.
  - Burgundy/colored mascara with icy blue inner corners as a winter signature.
  - Transparent‑base, colored‑sparkle highlighters (pink/blue, green) for “wet glass” payoff without casts.

- Unexpected Pairings:
  - Cream eye clays as lip color (MOB Memento); Blend Bunny multi‑use pencils across eyes/lips/face; black lip glaze layered over burgundy liner; glitter‑laden brows and lips; eye gloss for the “wet duochrome” that powder can’t mimic.

  - Curate a “Blue‑Brown Everywhere” set—shadow, eye gloss, and lip topper—to surf the week’s most-referenced shift.
  - Add a “Low‑Light Mode” to store swatch videos—half of every shimmer demo in dim lighting—to match how creators are validating sparkle IRL.
