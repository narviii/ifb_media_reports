# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key takeaway: Dec 8–14, 2025 skewed indie and seasonal. Holiday palettes, gothic-leaning textures, and blush layering dominated; creators paired strong visual demos with affiliate urgency, pushing immediate purchase intent.

## 1. Overview

- The week blended year-end “Best/Worst” verdicts with heavy holiday palette content and declutter culture. Viewers were steered toward texture-first indie releases while being warned off tacky, oily, or fussy base products.
- Eyeshadow drove excitement: multichromes, glitter toppers, and magnetic pans were the hooks. Aesthetics split between festive (reds/golds, icy blues) and dark-romance/goth (teals, purples, deep berries).
- Complexion discourse was pragmatic. Oily-skin performance, mattifying vs glow balance, and undertone specificity (especially bronzers) were emphasized. Shade-matching frustration for select foundations reappeared.
- Cheeks swung maximalist: liquid + powder blush stacking, luminous highlight, and visible sparkle took primacy over subtle soft-matte looks.
- Value talk surfaced in two ways: department-store gift sets (mainstream) and indie “code + swatch proof” launches. Packaging and collectibility remained purchase catalysts.

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

- Top-mentioned indie palettes (positive momentum)
  - Glaminatrix Merry Chrissy (AU): Multiple demos (battybean, Heather). Praised for festive color story, shimmer variety, and thematic packaging.
  - Gourmande Girls Mostly Merry (US): Repeated swatches and tutorials; snow-globe packaging + high-impact glitters; frequent code usage.
  - Blend Bunny Haunt Me Collection (US): Full collection review (Heather) with strong performance notes on the 24-pan magnetic palette and new lip oils/liners. Called “nailed it.”
  - Lethal Cosmetics Serpentine (DE): New 18-pan—short-form swatch hype; strong pigmentation and edgy packaging.
  - Fantasy Cosmetica Artificer (US): High marks for curated mattes/multichromes and an innovative shadow repress kit (“genius”).
  - Bella Beaute Bar Crystallize (US): Cool-toned, wintry palette positively received.
  - Unearthly Cosmetics Gothic Romance (US): High-energy swatch reveal—saturated jewel tones and complex shimmers.
  - Klarity Kosmetics The Other Side (US): Positive application demo; teal/blue metallic focus.

- Highlighter surge (indie-forward, sparkle-positive)
  - Bella Beaute Bar Skin of a Killer: “Perfect” blinding payoff.
  - Unearthly Low Light, Clionadh Fruitlighters, Kaleidos highlighters, Lethal collab highlights: repeated keeper status in declutters; visible sparkle welcomed.
  - ColourPop Super Shock (Grinch kit, collab editions): consistent love for texture and nostalgia.

- Cheeks and blush layering
  - Rare Beauty Soft Pinch (Joy, Truth) + powder toppers (Blend Bunny x Ellis Solar Flare): layered combos repeatedly showcased with strong wear and saturation.
  - R.E.M. Beauty Wicked Cherry Blossom blush palettes: positive, user-friendly.
  - Angelica “Best of”: ColourPop Glowy Weightless Liquid Blush, Natasha Denona Hy-Blush; Moira shimmer blush praised.
  - Angelica “Worst of”: Glow Recipe serum blush (too wet, lifts base), Revlon Blush Drops (overly pigmented, hard to blend), Dior stick (color good; formula sticky).

- Bronzer and base
  - Givenchy Prisme Libre Bronzing Powder: praised for sunkissed sheen without glitter.
  - Rachel’s bronzers: matte preference; strong use of Sigma, Fenty, GIVE Beauty (favorite), Makeup Revolution Ultra Cream (note: runs deep).
  - Foundation/powder mixed signals: Natasha Denona Hy-Glam (shade tricky; glow breaks through on oily skin but doesn’t break apart); About-Face powder not matte enough for oily; ONE/SIZE, Huda, Sigma powders preferred for control.

- Brows and lips
  - Make Beauty brow pencil/gel (quality good; price vs Morphe dupe): gel praised, pencil mixed on value.
  - Multiple lip combos: Lawless liner + Klarity gloss (nude gloss), Melt liner + Black Moon Dracula (deep red), Unearthly Villain + Gourmande Girls Poe (dark glitter), Kaleidos liner + Unearthly lipstick. Glossy, high-shine finishes favored; dark lips resurging within goth looks.

- Note clusters
  - “Lots of creators testing” holiday palettes (Glaminatrix, Gourmande Girls) and Blend Bunny’s new collection.
  - Multichrome/shimmer quality is the default comparison point in palette discussions.
  - Repeat criticism around sticky/tacky face products, oil-forward skin tints, and faulty spray mechanisms.

- Product combos tested
  - Liquid blush + powder blush layering (Rare Beauty + Blend Bunny).
  - Strong liner + gloss pairings (nude and goth variants).
  - Palette + multichrome liner + glitter topper stacks to amplify payoff.
  - Loose neon pigment + mixing medium for graphic accents.

## 3. Category Trends

- Momentum categories: eyeshadow palettes (holiday/goth), highlighters (iridescent/maximalist), blush (layered liquid + powder), and lips (liner + gloss).
- Aesthetics/textures: multichrome shimmers, glitter toppers, radiant bronzing, and “wet look” highlights; icy cool tones vs deep jewel/gothic tones; neon accents for graphic liner.
- Fatigue/skepticism: sticky/goopy textures (lips and blush), oily skin tints, over-pigmented bronzers that grab, and faulty spray delivery.
- Seasonal signals: festive reds/golds, cool blues/teals, cozy cabin and snow motifs, packaging-driven gifting. Gothic romance coexists with classic holiday looks, indicating broad winter demand.

## 4. Emerging Themes & Narratives

- Indie holiday palette wave (cross-creator): Glaminatrix Merry Chrissy, Gourmande Girls Mostly Merry, Blend Bunny Haunt Me surfaced across battybean, Heather, Angelica mentions, and Rachel’s new-release coverage.
- Texture-first purchasing: creators foreground multichrome payoffs, glitter intensity, and magnetic pans (Blend Bunny, Bella Beaute Bar; Fantasy Cosmetica repress kit for longevity).
- Layering techniques as value: cheeks (liquid + powder) and eyes (primer + multichrome + glitter) shown repeatedly to maximize impact and wear.
- Oily-skin pragmatism: repeated advice on mattifying zones (One/Size primer), powder preferences (ONE/SIZE, Huda, Sigma, Morphe Cloudlight) and caution with glow-forward bases.
- Packaging/collectibility: holiday collabs and novelty shapes drive keeps and buys (snow-globe palettes, heart compacts, nostalgic IP).
- Brand-origin momentum
  - Western indie dominance: US (Blend Bunny, Gourmande Girls, Fantasy Cosmetica, Bella Beaute Bar, Klarity, Unearthly), AU (Glaminatrix), DE (Lethal), SE (Oden’s Eye), CA (Clionadh).
  - Minimal K-/J-/C-beauty presence this week; Western indie visibility and sentiment outpaced mainstream, except select luxury base wins (Givenchy, Lancôme) used as performance benchmarks.

## 5. Purchase-Intent Signals

- Strong: multiple demos + affiliate codes + seasonal urgency (Glaminatrix Merry Chrissy; Gourmande Girls Mostly Merry; Blend Bunny Haunt Me; Bella Beaute Bar highlight). Short-form swatches on tattooed skin boost confidence.
- Endorsements with superlatives: “gorg,” “perfect,” “nailed it,” “genius” (repress kit), “top contender.” Repeated appearance across channels magnifies intent.
- Problem-solving utilities: repress kit, magnetic pans, and layering techniques framed as making products last longer and perform better.
- Value/dupe framing: Make vs Morphe brow; Macy’s set value—signals shoppers are price-aware but willing to spend on indie textures and packaging.
- Negative intent (avoidance): sticky/goopy formulas, oily skin tints, faulty sprays, overly pigmented grabbing bronzers; repeated cross-creator negatives imply real sales headwinds for those categories.
