# Weekly Instagram Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key Takeaway: Nov 10–16, 2025 saw icy, ethereal sparkle collide with grunge-brown lips. Multichrome-heavy indie launches (Terra Moons, Oden’s Eye, Shine by SD) and the MOB Beauty x Courtney Reverie drop drove intent, while short, technique-forward reels outperformed static posts.

## 6. Special insights

- Emerging Micro-Trends:
  - Yellow–grey “smoky haze” eyes with micro-glitter veil.
  - Two-toned lid symmetry (pink/green; teal/purple) made editorial yet approachable.
  - Blue/lilac highlighters for winter “frostbite glow” crossing into cheeks/body.

- Unexpected Pairings:
  - Eyeshadows as lip toppers (Terra Moons on lips), cream clay eyeshadow as blush (MOB Memento), contour sticks as lip liners (KJH), Banila Lip Base under gloss for “studio glass” lips.
  - Colored mascaras as “quiet color” accents (Fenty Arcane Blue).

- Creative insight:
  - Western brands adopting C-beauty shimmer sensibility (high-reflect, thin emollience) is accelerating (Danessa Myricks Lightwork praise). Position “East-meets-West sparkle” edits and education around particle size, base transparency, and layering to convert the sparkle-curious mainstream consumer.
