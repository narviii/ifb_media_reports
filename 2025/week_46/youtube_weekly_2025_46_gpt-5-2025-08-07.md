# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key takeaway (Nov 17–23, 2025): Indie eye palettes dominated creator coverage, with Fantasy Cosmetica’s Artificer launch (Nov 20) and Melt’s Edward Scissorhands collab driving the week’s highest enthusiasm, while alternative holiday aesthetics and complex shimmers set the tone.

## 1. Overview

- The week skewed heavily toward indie eyeshadow with overt launch hype. Creators emphasized swatch-proven performance (especially shimmers/multichromes), often on tattooed or deeper skin to signal opacity and payoff.
- Seasonal energy = “alternative holiday”: icy cool tones, grungy jewel tones, lime-green inner-corner pops, and vamp/dark lips. This isn’t soft festive; it’s collectible, themed, and high-impact.
- Affiliate-driven urgency was explicit (codes and launch times repeated), reinforced by Black Friday stackability messaging and scarcity cues (low stock callouts).
- Sentiment around celebrity-led launches soured: a critical GRWM rebuked toddler skincare (Rini), adding to the broader authenticity vs. commercialization narrative. In contrast, small fantasy/IP-driven indies were celebrated as passion-led.
- Utility talk surfaced via maintenance tools (depan/repress kits) and adhesives/primers that maximize shimmer payoff—an overlooked but sticky add-on category.

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

- Fantasy Cosmetica — Artificer Collection (9-pan palette; singles; tools)
  - Sentiment: strongly positive across three creators; one shimmer (“Infusion”) flagged as drier but workable (mixed note within an otherwise glowing set).
  - Context: 7 shimmers/3 mattes; standout silver (“Alloy”) and multichromes; heavy teaser cadence; launch-date urgency; affiliate incentives; bundles and tool ecosystem (Pan Remover, Repress Kit, Empty Magnetic Palette).
  - Hype status: peak pre-/launch-week interest; multiple creators, code-driven calls to action.

- Melt Cosmetics — Edward Scissorhands Palette
  - Sentiment: highly positive (“best shimmers yet” type language; intense, opaque swatches).
  - Context: Cool-toned icy blues/purples; collectible licensed collab; winter aesthetic; strong packaging discourse (snow globe detail).
  - Hype status: active post-launch momentum; positioned as a seasonal showpiece.

- ColourPop — The Grinch Palette (and Grinch lip/highlight tie-ins via other creators)
  - Sentiment: positive for versatility and pigment.
  - Context: Licensed holiday IP still pulls attention; key usage pattern = lime metallic inner-corner against smoky reds/plums.
  - Hype status: mass-collab anchor; creators use it as a look-driver not just a novelty.

- Klarity Kosmetics — The Other Side Palette
  - Sentiment: very positive; “favorite look” of a multi-palette video; “low stock” implied.
  - Context: Moody jewel tones + shifty shimmers; aligns with grunge/fantasy winter.
  - Hype status: organic word-of-mouth lift; scarcity/low inventory signals.

- Simply Posh — Gingerbread Bakery Palette
  - Sentiment: positive; half-neutral/half-pastel; glossy shimmers.
  - Context: Soft “sugar cookie” looks with color accents; seasonal but not IP.

- Lips/Adjacencies with traction:
  - Menagerie (Liquid Lips): positive (deep brown “almost black,” seasonal berry).
  - Unearthly (Lip Liners): positive; frequent combo builder.
  - Blend Bunny x Mei Pang (Lip Glaze): positive; blue/purple shift, used over dark base.
  - Adhesives/Primers: Clionadh Shine On and NYX Glitter Primer repeatedly used to boost shimmers (practical must-haves).
  - White liner gap: UD Ozone called “streaky” when used as a base—room for a higher-performing alternative.

## 3. Category Trends

- Eyeshadow Palettes: Clear lead category; multichromes/duochromes and ultra-metallics are the purchase driver. Silvers and olive/green shifts stood out; terracotta/brown mattes used as anchors.
- Aesthetics/Textures: Cool-toned icy blue/purple looks and grungy jewel tones; “lime pop” inner corners; glossy, molten metallic lids; reverse smoky/graphic placements.
- Lips: Return of vamp/dark and high-saturation reds; liner+liquid lip “cocktailing” to customize tone/contrast; shifty toppers over dark bases.
- Tools/Accessories: Rising chatter on depanning/repress tools and empty magnetic palettes; adhesives/eye primers central to shimmer success.
- Seasonal Shift: Holiday collabs with nostalgic IP; “alternative festive” over classic glam; collectibility/packaging emphasized.

## 4. Emerging Themes & Narratives

- Indie Launch Surge with Themed Storytelling
  - Cross-creator alignment on Fantasy Cosmetica’s Artificer drop; fantasy/RPG theming and cohesive ecosystems (tools, singles, empty palettes) resonate with collector behavior.

- Shimmer/Multi-chrome Supremacy
  - Multiple creators prioritized swatches and eye-catchers like a hyper-opaque silver; performance on tattooed/darker skin used as proof.

- Affiliate-Driven, Time-Boxed Purchasing
  - Codes, stacking with Black Friday, and precise drop times repeated across creators; urgency and value framing are synchronized.

- Alternative Holiday Aesthetics
  - Icy/grunge palettes and lime accent trends recur; IP (Edward Scissorhands, Grinch) signals appetite for nostalgic, offbeat holiday narratives.

- Authenticity vs. Celebrity Playbook
  - Pushback against celebrity beauty cash-grabs (toddler skincare) contrasts with enthusiastic indie support; viewers nudged toward purpose-built, creator-endorsed products.

- Regional Market Signals
  - Western indie dominates (Fantasy Cosmetica, Melt, Klarity, Simply Posh, Menagerie, Unearthly, Blend Bunny).
  - K-beauty cameo: Laneige lip treatment praised (giftable lip care lane).
  - C-beauty presence via Kaleidos blush/liners in looks (not central, but compatible with the week’s color stories).

## 5. Purchase-Intent Signals

- High-conviction endorsements: “one of my favorite palettes from the brand,” “loving so much,” and “omggg” around Artificer and Melt collab.
- Visual proof: Dense, reflective swatches (especially silvers and multichromes) shown on textured/tattooed skin drive confidence.
- Scarcity/collectibility: Licensed IP and “low stock” cues increase urgency; limited drop windows amplify early conversions.
- Code stacking/value: Clear messaging that affiliate codes stack around Black Friday for non-new items—expect cart expansion beyond the hero palette.
- Ecosystem bundling: Tools (Pan Remover, Repress Kit), empty magnetic palettes, and singles create natural basket-building.
- Lip combos: Repeated liner + liquid lip layering shows intent to purchase multi-item “recipes.”

## 6. Opportunities for the Store

- Prioritize high-impact shimmer inventory
  - Secure or expand multichrome/duochrome singles and hyper-bright metallics (esp. an opaque, neutral-leaning silver; olive/green shifts; fiery copper/red metallics).
  - Stock or feature eye bases/adhesives that enhance payoff (e.g., Clionadh-style shimmer primers, glitter primers).

- Lean into “Alternative Holiday” curation
  - Bundle “grungy winter dream” sets: icy blue/purple metallic singles + deep/vamp lip + adhesive.
  - Create a “lime-pop” add-on: metallic lime single for inner corners to emulate Grinch looks across any palette.

- Capitalize on the Artificer halo, even if not stocking the brand
  - Merchandise a “fantasy artisan” edit: terracotta/brown mattes + complex green/silver shimmers + magnetic empty palettes and tool kits.
  - Carry maintenance tools (repress/depan) regardless of brand—strong add-on with high margin and collector utility.

- Bet on moody jewel palettes and grunge
  - If possible, secure units of Klarity’s The Other Side or similar color stories; increase buys where “low stock” chatter appears.
  - Carry half-neutral/half-pastel formats (e.g., Simply Posh vibe) that let customers build “soft base + accent” looks.

- Lip category growth via combos
  - Stock deep brown and berry liquid lips alongside versatile dark/red liners; add shifty toppers/glazes to upsell finish customization.

- Fill the white-liner performance gap
  - Introduce a highly opaque, non-streak white liner (water-activated cakes or high-opacity gels) as a problem-solver versus UD Ozone.

- Giftable lip care lane
  - Add tinted lip treatments/oils with elegant applicators (Laneige-like experience), ideally from indie/K-leaning partners for differentiation.

- De-prioritize
  - Celebrity/child-focused skincare and gimmick categories; current sentiment is hostile and misaligned with the store’s indie authority positioning.

- Execution notes
  - Time offer windows to coincide with creator-driven hype (next 2 weeks): promote bundles, tool add-ons, and code-friendly value messaging.
  - On-site merchandising: “Get the Look” capsules (Edward Scissorhands cool tones; Grinch lime pop; Artificer spicy neutrals + metals) with 3–5 SKUs per capsule to drive AOV.
