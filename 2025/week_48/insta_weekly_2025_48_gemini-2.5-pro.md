# Weekly Instagram Beauty Media Landscape Report

*   **Key Takeaway:** The week of November 24 - 30, 2025, was dominated by a wave of Black Friday launches from key indie brands, driving a "dark and sparkly" aesthetic. Moody, grunge-inspired eyeshadow palettes from Cosmic Brushes and festive-yet-deep collections from Dede's Signature captured audience attention, while Kaleidos' innovative "Moon Arcade" lip and liner collection generated significant purchase intent through high-performing tutorial and swatch reels.

## 1. Overview

*   **The Vibe:** The feed was a battleground for Black Friday attention. The atmosphere was charged with newness, characterized by unboxings, first impressions, and detailed swatch videos of imminent launches. The dominant aesthetic was a fusion of grunge, goth, and festive glamour, with creators showcasing deep, moody color stories punctuated by high-impact, multi-dimensional sparkle.
*   **Engagement Temperature:** Engagement was highly transactional and inquisitive. Followers were actively comparing new products to past releases (e.g., Cosmic Brushes' "Death" vs. "Sinister" palettes) and explicitly stating their intent to purchase. Comments were less about general compliments and more focused on specific shades, formula performance, and sale details, indicating a highly informed and purchase-ready audience.

## 2. Product Momentum (Brand & Item Velocity)

*   **Top Mentioned Brands:**
    *   **Cosmic Brushes:** Dominated conversations with the launch of the "Death" palette.
    *   **Kaleidos Makeup:** Generated massive buzz for its new "Moon Arcade" collection.
    *   **Rituel de Fille:** Heavily featured for its "Ghost Frequency" Black Friday exclusive collection.
    *   **Dede's Signature:** Successfully launched its "Festive Elegance" holiday palette.
    *   **Lethal Cosmetics:** Drove interest with its "Serpentine" palette and new lip stains.

*   **Viral Products:**
    *   **Cosmic Brushes "Death" Palette:** Appeared in multiple high-engagement swatch videos. The unique grungy-yet-colorful story resonated strongly, sparking numerous requests for comparison swatches against previous palettes, proving a dedicated collector base.
    *   **Kaleidos "Moon Arcade" Collection:** The **Epiphany Glow Eyeliner in "Scarlet Striker"** (a vibrant, true red glitter) and the **Glass Load Lip Melts** (especially the grey shade "Stranger" and the sparkly toppers) were breakout stars. The novelty of the colors and the refillable packaging were key drivers of interest.
    *   **Rituel de Fille "Ghost Frequency" Collection:** The gift-with-purchase strategy created urgency. The **"Apparition" Rare Light Crème Luminizer** (a fuchsia cream highlight) and **"Midnight Glow" Thorn Bite Lip Oil** (a rust-red with blue/green sparkle) were heavily swatched and coveted.

*   **The "Look" Breakdown:**
    *   **EYES:** A clear trend towards complex, "oil slick" and holographic shimmers. Graphic liner was a major theme, especially using bold, colorful glitter pencils like those from Kaleidos. Color stories were moody, featuring deep teals, reds, and purples.
    *   **LIPS:** A duel of textures. High-shine, multi-dimensional sparkly lip oils and balms (Rituel de Fille, Kaleidos) were contrasted with deep, vampy satin and stained lips (Lethal Cosmetics, Rituel de Fille's "Hemlock"). The use of dark or black lip liner to create a grungy contour was prominent.
    *   **CHEEKS:** The monochromatic look, using a single cream/balm product on cheeks and eyes, gained traction. Colorful, dewy highlighters were used as a combination blush-and-highlight, creating a seamless, ethereal glow.

## 3. Aesthetic & Hashtag Trends

*   **Visual Themes:** Hashtags like **#gothmakeup**, **#grungemakeup**, and **#altmakeup** were the most prevalent, defining the week's mood. This was complemented by a niche but highly engaged **#snowflakemakeup** trend, showcasing intricate pastel and white graphic liner work for the holiday season.
*   **Color Stories:**
    *   **Grungy Jewel Tones:** The Cosmic Brushes "Death" palette solidified a palette of deep teals, rich burgundies, moody purples, and gunmetal grays.
    *   **Pink & Green:** A recurring "Wicked"-inspired combination seen in custom palettes and the new Lethal Cosmetics "Serpentine" palette, pairing vibrant pinks with emerald and lime greens.
    *   **Festive with Depth:** Dede's Signature "Festive Elegance" palette provided a holiday theme for the alternative consumer, using deep forest greens and rich crimson reds instead of brighter, more traditional holiday shades.

## 4. Purchase-Intent Signals (From Comments)

*   **"Add to Cart" Energy:**
    *   Cosmic Brushes "Death" Palette: "Yep, this shall be mine" and "So now I need this one too" were common sentiments.
    *   Dede's Signature "Festive Elegance": "This is an immediate add to cart!!! I’m obsessed" and "I need this palette."
    *   Rituel de Fille Collection: "Omg I can’t wait to buy this!!" (referring to the Apparition luminizer).

*   **Restock Demands:** Comments on a Bella Beaute Bar feature noted the **"Ocean Jewel" palette was out of stock**, highlighting lingering demand for popular items from the brand's existing catalog.

*   **Curiosity Clusters:**
    *   **Palette Comparisons:** The most significant cluster of questions involved requests for swatch comparisons between the new Cosmic Brushes "Death" palette and their previous "Sinister" palette. This indicates a savvy, collector-driven audience that makes calculated purchasing decisions.
    *   **Formula Inquiries:** Followers asked for comparisons between Kaleidos' new Lip Melts and their older Lip Glaze formula, showing interest in texture and performance specifics.
    *   **Application Techniques:** The intricate snowflake graphic liner look prompted questions about the best brushes for water-activated liners, signaling that visually complex tutorials can directly drive tool-related inquiries.

## 5. Opportunities for the Store

*   **Stocking Recommendations:**
    *   Immediately prioritize the **Cosmic Brushes "Death" Palette** and the **Kaleidos "Moon Arcade" collection**, particularly the "Scarlet Striker" eyeliner and the unique Glass Load Lip Melt shades.
    *   Invest heavily in **multi-dimensional special effect eyeshadows**: multichromes, holos, and "oil slick" toppers are non-negotiable for this audience.
    *   Expand the **colorful eyeliner** category. The success of the Kaleidos launch proves there is a strong appetite for high-performance glitter and satin liners in unconventional shades like red, blue, and gray.

*   **Content Strategy:**
    *   **Produce Comparison Swatch Content:** For brands with a cult following, showing new products alongside established favorites is a powerful conversion tool. This addresses the collector's primary question: "Is this different enough from what I already own?"
    *   **Prioritize Tutorial Reels for Complex Looks:** High-skill, aesthetic-driven tutorials (like the snowflake liner) achieve massive reach (over 200k+ plays) and position the featured products as tools for artistry, not just color.
    *   **Leverage Close-Up Video:** The shifty, sparkly nature of this week's viral products cannot be captured in static photos. Short, looping videos that showcase texture and light reflection are essential for product pages and social feeds.

*   **Gap Analysis:** A comment on a Cosmic Brushes post expressed a clear unmet need: "WHY CANT ANYONE MAKE A TRUE SPARKLY RED THAT DOESNT SHIFT ORANGE OR HAVE A BLACK BASE." This signals a market opportunity for a true, cool-toned, highly sparkly red single eyeshadow.

## 6. Special insights

*   **Emerging Micro-Trends:**
    *   **"Medieval Core":** Influencer `ghoul.in.japan` curated a makeup collection based on a "medieval" aesthetic, focusing on jewel tones, aged metallics, and parchment-like mattes. This highly specific, thematic approach to makeup curation is a niche but potent trend.
    *   **Monochromatic Balm Draping:** The technique of using a single pigmented balm (like Rituel de Fille's "Snowdrop") across eyes, cheeks, and lips for a cohesive, dewy, and colorful look is emerging as a sophisticated take on minimal-effort makeup.

*   **Unexpected Pairings:**
    *   **Black Liner for Lip Contouring:** Instead of a standard brown, creators are using black pencil eyeliner to sharply define the lip line before applying gloss, achieving a distinctly bold, grungy, and high-contrast lip look.

*   **Creative insight:**
    *   **The Power of Curation as Content:** The most forward-thinking content this week moved beyond single-product reviews. Creators are curating "Top 5" lists for a brand's sale or building an entire makeup tray around a specific aesthetic theme ("Medieval Core"). This positions them as trusted editors, not just reviewers, and provides a powerful marketing angle to move both new launches and existing catalog items by creating a compelling narrative.
    *   **C-Beauty's Aesthetic Influence:** The continued rise of brands like Kaleidos, Flower Knows, and Girlcult (tagged with #cbeauty) is introducing new textures (e.g., opaque grey lip balms), packaging concepts (refillable lipsticks), and color stories that are pushing the boundaries of the Western indie market.
