# Weekly Instagram Beauty Media Landscape Report

*   **Key Takeaway:** For the week of November 24 - November 30, 2025, the indie beauty landscape was dominated by a frenzy of Black Friday launches, creating a distinct split between dark, grungy aesthetics and classic festive glamour. Brands like Cosmic Brushes and Kaleidos drove a moody, cool-toned narrative, while video content, particularly swatch comparisons and tutorials, proved essential for generating high purchase intent.

## 1. Overview

*   **The Vibe:** The feed was an intense mix of launch announcements, swatch-heavy reels, and first-impression tutorials. Black Friday was the clear driver, with brands like Cosmic Brushes, Dede's Signature, Rituel de Fille, and Kaleidos flooding the timeline with new collections. The mood was bifurcated: one half embraced grungy, tarot-inspired darkness, while the other leaned into traditional red-and-green holiday sparkle.

*   **Engagement Temperature:** Follower sentiment was electric and highly transactional. Comments moved beyond simple compliments to specific, purchase-oriented questions. Excitement was palpable for new palettes, with users tagging friends, declaring their intent to buy, and demanding swatch comparisons to avoid purchasing duplicates from previous launches.

## 2. Product Momentum (Brand & Item Velocity)

*   **Top Mentioned Brands:**
    *   **Kaleidos Makeup:** Massive push for their "Moon Arcade" collection.
    *   **Rituel de Fille:** Dominated feeds with their tiered "Ghost Frequency" Black Friday releases.
    *   **Cosmic Brushes:** Generated significant hype with a single palette launch.
    *   **Dede's Signature:** Captured the traditional holiday market with their "Festive Elegance" collection.

*   **Viral Products:**
    *   **Cosmic Brushes "Death" Palette:** The week's clear winner in terms of palette hype. Multiple influencers showcased its moody, complex color story, sparking intense discussion and direct purchase declarations ("Yep, this shall be mine").
    *   **Kaleidos "Moon Arcade" Collection:** The **Glass Load Lip Melts** (especially the grey "Stranger" and sparkly "Frizz Melt") and the **Epiphany Glow Melt-on Eyeliner** in "Scarlet Striker" (a vibrant, true red) were standout items featured in numerous tutorials and swatch posts.
    *   **Rituel de Fille "Ghost Frequency" Collection:** The multi-use **"Snowdrop" Color Nectar Pigment Balm** (a cool cherry blossom pink) and **"Apparition" Rare Light Crème Luminizer** (a fuchsia flash) appeared in multiple ethereal looks, driving interest in the brand's tiered gift-with-purchase sale structure.

*   **The "Look" Breakdown:**
    *   **EYES:** A strong emphasis on high-impact, textural finishes. Multichrome, holographic, and intensely sparkly toppers were ubiquitous. Graphic liner, particularly using the vibrant Kaleidos pencils, was a key technique.
    *   **LIPS:** High-shine, glossy finishes reigned supreme. The trend was led by comfortable, non-sticky formulas like the Rituel de Fille Thorn Bite Lip Oils and Kaleidos Glass Load Lip Melts. This was balanced by deep, vampy sheers and metallic lipsticks for a grungier edge.
    *   **CHEEKS:** The monochromatic "draping" technique, using a single cream product on eyes, cheeks, and lips, was a sophisticated micro-trend. Colorful, non-traditional highlighters (like the fuchsia Rituel de Fille "Apparition") were favored over standard champagne tones.

## 3. Aesthetic & Hashtag Trends

*   **Visual Themes:** A clear battle between darkness and light.
    *   **#gothmakeup & #grungemakeup:** This was the dominant aesthetic, fueled by the cool-toned, moody palettes from Cosmic Brushes and the alternative shades in the Kaleidos collection.
    *   **#wintermakeup & #snowflakemakeup:** A highly engaged counter-trend, led by a viral tutorial from `linsmakeuplooks` featuring intricate white graphic liner and pastel tones.
    *   **#festiveelegance:** A smaller but dedicated trend around classic holiday looks, driven by the Dede's Signature launch.

*   **Color Stories:**
    *   **Moody & Cool:** Deep purples, blood reds, murky teals, and an array of cool-toned greys were the primary colors of the grunge aesthetic.
    *   **Classic Festive:** Rich forest greens, true crimson reds, and brilliant golds defined the holiday looks.
    *   **Icy & Ethereal:** Pastel rainbows, cool fuchsia pinks, and iridescent blues created a dreamy, wintery vibe.

## 4. Purchase-Intent Signals (From Comments)

*   **"Add to Cart" Energy:** Comments were direct and decisive.
    *   On Cosmic Brushes "Death" Palette: "Yep, this shall be mine," and "So now I need this one too."
    *   On Dede's Signature "Festive Elegance": "Yes, this is an immediate add to cart!!! I’m obsessed."
    *   On Rituel de Fille's collection: "You were the one that sold me on buying enough to get the whole collection."

*   **Restock Demands:** Highlighting scarcity and demand, commenters noted that the **Bella Beaute Bar "Ocean Jewel" palette** was sold out during the Black Friday sale, indicating strong, unmet interest.

*   **Curiosity Clusters:** The audience is educated and wants details before buying.
    *   **Product Comparisons:** The most frequent question was for swatch comparisons of the new **Cosmic Brushes "Death" palette** against their previous "Sinister" palette. This signals a loyal, returning customer base looking to make informed purchases.
    *   **Technique & Tools:** A viral snowflake makeup look sparked questions about the best brushes for water-activated liners, showing a desire to replicate techniques, not just buy products.

## 5. Opportunities for the Store

*   **Stocking Recommendations:**
    *   **Hero Palette:** The **Cosmic Brushes "Death" Palette** is a non-negotiable due to overwhelming hype.
    *   **Key SKUs:** Prioritize the **Kaleidos "Scarlet Striker" Eyeliner** for its unique color and graphic potential. Stock the **Kaleidos Glass Load Lip Melts**, focusing on the unconventional grey, lilac, and iridescent glitter shades. The **Rituel de Fille "Apparition" Luminizer** and **"Midnight Glow" Lip Oil** tap directly into the colorful highlight and high-shine lip trends.
    *   **Textures:** Focus on multichrome eyeshadows and high-shine, comfortable lip oils/balms.

*   **Content Strategy:**
    *   **Prioritize Reels for Launches:** Video content demonstrating swatches, shifts, and application significantly outperforms static images for new collections.
    *   **Create Comparison Content:** Produce swatch videos comparing new palettes to beloved older ones from the same brand. This directly addresses the primary customer question and builds immense trust.
    *   **Showcase Technique:** Tutorials that break down a specific, trending look (like graphic snowflakes) can drive sales of ancillary products like brushes and primers.

*   **Gap Analysis:** A commenter expressed frustration with finding a "true sparkly red that doesnt shift orange or have a black base." While the Kaleidos red liner is close, a true sparkly red eyeshadow single or palette feature remains a clear market opportunity.

## 6. Special insights

*   **Emerging Micro-Trends:**
    *   **"Medieval Core":** Influencer `ghoul.in.japan` curated an entire makeup selection based on a "medieval core" theme, featuring jewel tones, aged parchment shades, and metallics. This points to a new, art-history-driven aesthetic that is highly specific and visually rich.
    *   **Monochromatic Draping:** The sophisticated use of a single cream product across eyes, cheeks, and lips (seen with Rituel de Fille's "Snowdrop" balm) is an editorial technique gaining traction for its cohesive, modern feel.

*   **Unexpected Pairings:** The combination of deeply grungy, matte eyeshadow with hyper-glossy, sparkly lip oils was a recurring look. This textural contrast between a dark, moody eye and a bright, wet-look lip feels fresh and modern.

*   **Creative insight:** The role of the influencer is evolving from "reviewer" to **"trusted curator."** During the noise of Black Friday, creators who curated "top recommendations" lists for brand sales, built custom palettes from single shadows, or themed their monthly makeup selections provided immense value. This editorial guidance is becoming more critical than a simple product demo, especially for overwhelming sales events. The success of deeply personal creator collaborations, like the Shellwe Makeup x Ghoul in Japan "Nocturnal Flame" collection, further proves that an authentic, curated vision resonates powerfully with niche audiences.
