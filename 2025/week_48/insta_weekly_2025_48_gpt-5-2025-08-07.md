# Weekly Instagram Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key Takeaway: Nov 24–30, 2025 delivered a Black Friday-fueled indie surge: sparkly, long-wear eye toppers and bold liners dominated, while red–green holiday palettes with real depth led purchase intent. Tutorial reels, macro-sparkle swatches, and comparison content drove the strongest engagement.

## 1. Overview

- The Vibe:
  - Launch week energy across multiple indie drops (Cosmic Brushes, Dede’s Signature, Kaleidos, Rituel de Fille, Lethal). Feeds skewed to swatch carousels and close-up sparkly demos, with seasonal looks (snowflake liner, grunge Christmas) and “one-and-done” glossy lids.
  - Alt/goth aesthetics threaded through the week: oil-slick eye gloss, gray/teal/blackened lips, medieval-core curations, and graphic red liner.
- Engagement Temperature:
  - Hot. Followers asked for shade comparisons, undertone breakdowns, and links; many declared intent to buy, tagged friends, and referenced past OOS pain points.
  - Notable asks: side-by-side palette comparisons (Cosmic Death vs Sinister/Cooltrals/Smolder), “true metallic red” demands, brush recs for water-activated liner, and UK availability for limited drops.

## 5. Opportunities for the Store

- Stocking Recommendations:
  - Sparkle infrastructure: multichrome singles (Clionadh/Terra Moons/Fantasy Cosmetica), holo/iridescent toppers, oil-slick gelée eye glosses.
  - Long-wear, sparkly liners: especially red shimmer (true red, no orange shift, no black base), plus blues/greys; water-activated liners and pro brushes.
  - Holiday palettes with depth: red/green/gold stories that include olive/mustard/teal/gray mattes and multiple metallic textures.
  - Lip ecosystem: iridescent balm-sticks/lip melts (refillable where possible), non-tingly plumping lip oils, gray/taupe/blackened glosses, deep brown liners.
  - Inclusive swatch assets: ensure deep-skin swatches for pastel mattes and holo silvers.
- Content Strategy:
  - Comparison reels and undertone explainers (Cosmic Death vs Sinister etc.)—highly requested.
  - Macro-sparkle demos under multiple lighting; “one-and-done” eye gloss looks.
  - Tutorial reels for seasonal graphic liner (snowflake/red wing) and emerald “serpentine” looks.
  - “Stack your cart” GWP navigation content; code-stacking callouts; UK/EU availability notes where relevant.
  - Tool tips: water-activated liner brush guide; “keep your face relaxed” application hacks (echoing pro-artist education).
- Gap Analysis:
  - Unmet demand for a true metallic red shimmer (non-orange, non–black base). Opportunity to source or develop.
  - Eye gloss guidance: prime/setting strategies to mitigate creasing; bundle with a compatible base.
  - Advent calendar sentiment skewed negative on minis/value—curate fewer, better-value sets if participating.

## 6. Special insights

- Emerging Micro-Trends:
  - Gray lip balm/gloss as a wearable alt neutral; taupe-gray lip liners paired with iridescent balms.
  - Inner-corner “beam” technique using high-shine eye gloss taken up and down the nose bridge for editorial gleam.
  - Medieval-core curations: jewel-tone metallics, parchment yellows, oxidized bronzes packaged as monthly “kits.”
- Unexpected Pairings:
  - Lip oils over lip sheers for lacquered depth; lipstick-as-cheek and color balms across eyes/cheeks/lips (monochrome cherry blossom pink).
  - Holo/diamond sparkle layered over matte reds to achieve “oil-slick” cherry metals without black bases.
- Creative insight:
  - Refillable sparkle sticks (Kaleidos) suggest a broader shift toward modular, collectible sparkle formats. A curated “Sparkle Lab” landing page—segmenting iridescent toppers by undertone/shift and pairing with suggested liners/lip bases—would both educate and convert during peak holiday traffic.
