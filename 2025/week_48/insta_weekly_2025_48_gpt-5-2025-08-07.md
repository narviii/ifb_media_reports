# Weekly Instagram Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key Takeaway: Nov 24–30, 2025 saw a grunge-holiday crossover: red/green “Christmas with depth,” blurple sparkles, and oil‑slick gloss looks dominated. Tutorial reels, side‑by‑side comparisons, and swatch carousels around new drops (Cosmic Brushes Death, Kaleidos Moon Arcade, Rituel de Fille Ghost Frequency, Lethal Serpentine) unlocked the highest purchase intent.

## 1. Overview

- The Vibe:
  - Pre–Black Friday flood of launch reels, macro swatches, and comparison content (Cosmic Brushes Death vs Sinister/Cooltrals/Smolder; Kaleidos new liners/lip melts vs earlier gloss formulas).
  - Alt/goth artistry anchored the feed (graphic red liner, snowflake liner, oil‑slick eye gloss, blurple multichromes) with holiday color stories shown in moody lighting, macro sparkle, and editorial flatlays (tarot props, festive cookies).
  - GRWM/tutorial narrations and “not‑to‑miss shades” roundups performed best; static macro lips/eyes supported product texture storytelling.

- Engagement Temperature:
  - Hot. Repeated “add to cart,” “link?”, “code stacks?”; heavy comparison requests; multiple “sold out”/restock mentions; region questions (UK availability). Brand replies and creator code guidance kept momentum high.

## 6. Special insights

- Emerging Micro‑Trends (early signals):
  - Gray/taupe lip balms and brown‑black glossy lips as everyday alt neutrals.
  - Fuchsia “pure glow” cream highlighters (no sparkle) as color‑shift cheek lights.
  - Inner‑corner glitter “spires” reaching brow bone as a signature sparkle map.
  - Snowflake/holiday graphic liner returning in crisp six‑point designs.

- Unexpected Pairings/Uses:
  - Multi‑use blush balms (Snowdrop) as eye bases; lip sheers topped with iridescent balms; face highlighters (Bellabeautébar Dark Dreamscape) on lips/brow bone; blotted lip stains topped with balms for comfort + wear.

- Creative Insight:
  - Build a “Red Metallic Hunt” microsite: live comparison swatches (Ruby Flame vs Death red shimmer vs brand X), macro shifts, and undertone callouts to capture pent‑up demand.
  - Launch a “Blurple Week” featuring Clionadh/indie singles with day/night eye maps and liner pairings.
  - Create a “Medieval Core” capsule: aged parchment mattes, jewel‑tone metallics, yellowed contour (“jaundiced old painting” vibe), and colored mascaras—packaged with a story card (art history tie‑ins).
  - Maintain a “Comparison Library” highlight for hot palettes; it directly reduces purchase friction (“Will you compare to Sinister?” comments were frequent).

Overall: Lean into alt‑holiday grunge with proof‑based comparisons, macro sparkle storytelling, and problem‑solving kits (true red shimmer; crease‑smart gloss). This week’s audience came ready to buy—make choosing easy, clear, and shippable.
