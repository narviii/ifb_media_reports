# Weekly Instagram Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key Takeaway: Nov 24–30, 2025 delivered a Black Friday-fueled spike in indie launches and sparkle-forward, alt-goth beauty. Kaleidos’ comeback (Moon Arcade), Cosmic Brushes’ Death Tarot palette, and Rituel de Fille’s Ghost Frequency drove the week’s demand while creators leaned into grungy holiday reds/greens, iridescent lips, and oil-slick eye gloss.

## 1. Overview

- The Vibe:
  - Launch-and-swatch week: fast-cut reels, macro arm swatches, side-by-side comparisons, and creator “top recs” dominated.
  - Looks skewed alt and editorial: graphic liners (snowflakes, claw wings), oil-gloss lids, heavy inner-corner-to-brow shimmer streaks, and bleached/soft brows.
  - Holiday palettes were “grunge Christmas” (depthy reds/greens, chartreuse, teal) vs. standard festive glam.

- Engagement Temperature:
  - Buyers asked for links, code stacking, comparisons, and undertone breakdowns; multiple “this shall be mine,” “add to cart,” and OOS mentions.
  - Teaching/troubleshooting content performed: brush recs, liner technique, and “keep your face still” application hacks spurred saves/shares.
  - Viral resonance clusters: Kaleidos new red liner staying red; Cosmic Brushes comparisons (Death vs Sinister/Cooltrals/Smolder); Rituel’s GWPs strategy.

## 6. Special Insights

- Emerging Micro-Trends:
  - Gray is the new neutral: gray lip balms/glosses/liners; greige taupes paired with blue sparkles.
  - Oil-slick eyes: brown/silver gelee with high-wet glare replacing pressed glitter for “one-and-done.”
  - Holochromes back on the lid; holographic sparkle called out repeatedly.

- Unexpected Pairings:
  - Multi-use pigments: blush balms on eyes/lips; suspended sparkle balms as nose/above-crease highlights.
  - Red waterline pairings with neutral lids; periwinkle lower lash pops under green lids.

- Creative insight:
  - Lean into “ritual objects” visual language (tarot cards, velvet, candles) for holiday alt-glam: it photographed and performed better than sterile flatlays.
  - Promote refillability/modularity (Kaleidos refillable lip melts; Dede’s magnetic pans) as value during BF—audiences reward sustainable, customizable systems.
  - Bundle “Practice Makes Precision” kits: water-activated liners + pro liner brush + eye gloss + gem adhesive, targeting the graphic-liner resurgence (snowflakes/linework).
