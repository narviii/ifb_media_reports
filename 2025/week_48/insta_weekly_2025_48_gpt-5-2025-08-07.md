## 5. Opportunities for the Store

- Stocking Recommendations:
  - Kaleidos Moon Arcade: prioritize Scarlet Striker red liner; Miss Matrix/Moon Mechanic blues; Stranger gray balm; Frizz Melt/Cheat Code/Geek Out lip melts; deep lip liners (Merlot, Java).
  - Cosmic Brushes Death Palette: launch support + comparison content; emphasize holochrome and non-black-base jewel shimmers; meet red-metallic demand.
  - DeDe’s Signature Festive Elegance + gradient singles: push “holiday with depth” and magnetic customization.
  - Rituel de Fille core: Rare Light Creme Luminizers (Apparition-type), Levitation Lash, Thorn Bite lip oils; if exclusives unavailable, mirror shades/finishes customers want (oil-slick eye toppers, obsidian/plum lip sheers).
  - Lethal Serpentine + Infinity Lip Stains: highlight Basilisk, “US warehouse” shipping advantage.
  - Clionadh singles: curate the 9 highlighted shades; bundle “green/pink Wicked” or “oil-slick neutral” sets.
  - Alt statement lips: Jolie Metallics (teal “Earthly”), black gloss options.

- Content Strategy:
  - Side-by-side comparison reels (Cosmic Death vs Sinister/Cooltrals/Smolder; red shimmers across brands).
  - 30–60s “one-and-done” eye demos (Crux-style gloss; single multichrome lid).
  - Graphic liner shorts: red block wing, snowflake details; brush/tool recommendations for water-activated liner (viewers asked).
  - “Build your holiday grunge” kits (greens/reds + silver/brown toppers) and “medieval core” mini-capsules.
  - Creator-code amplification and “stackable codes” messaging (Clionadh, Kaleidos, Lethal, RdF) to capture BF urgency.

- Gap Analysis:
  - True sparkly red shadow: demand for a bright red shimmer that isn’t orange-shifting or black-based—curate/commission a true-crimson metallic/glitter.
  - Crease-resistant glossy lids: offer eye-safe, longer-set gelées/creams with minimal creasing tips/base combos.
  - Tools: water-activated liner brush recs set (firm, fine tips) addressing “my brush is too flimsy” pain point.

## 6. Special insights

- Emerging Micro-Trends:
  - Gray lip balm and dusty-lilac glossy lips in alt looks; metallic teal lipstick as a holiday statement.
  - Inner-corner-to-browbone “sparkle cascade” highlight becoming a signature shot across creators.
  - Holochrome callouts in palettes are becoming a key selling term, not just “multichrome.”

- Unexpected Pairings:
  - Lip oils and glazes layered over deep liners for complex, editorial lips; black gloss over softened lip base.
  - Magnetic singles swapped into holiday palettes for iridescent inner corners; blush balms doubled on eyes.

- Creative insight:
  - Package a “Graphic Holiday” kit: Scarlet red liner + icy white detail liner + oil-slick topper + brush duo for water-activated detail; pair with a green-smoke quad. Market as “grunge Christmas in 5 minutes.”
  - For shoppers chasing GWP ladders (Rituel de Fille), build cart-saving guides showing thresholds and shade pairings to reach tiers with minimal waste—commenters explicitly strategized to get all freebies.
