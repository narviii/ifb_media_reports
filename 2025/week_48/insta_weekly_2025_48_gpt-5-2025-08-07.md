# Weekly Instagram Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key Takeaway: Nov 24–30, 2025 leaned hard into grunge-glam holiday beauty: moody tarot palettes, sparkly oil-slick lids, and “fun makeup is back” lip toppers. Kaleidos’ comeback and a trio of holiday palettes (Cosmic Beauty Death, Dede Signature Festive Elegance, Lethal Serpentine) set the tone, while comment threads signaled real purchase intent and comparison-shopping.

## 1. Overview

- The Vibe:
  - Product-first swatch reels and side-by-side comparisons dominated (palette dupe checks, shade match-offs).
  - High-shine textures everywhere: holo/iridescent multichromes, sparkly balms, and true eye gloss “oil-slick” lids.
  - Strong creative looks anchoring launches: graphic snowflake liner, pastel winter rainbows, “medieval core” jewel-tone curation, and goth holiday beats.
- Engagement Temperature:
  - Hot. Threads filled with “add to cart,” restock notes, and “link/code?” asks. Multiple requests for comparison swatches (Cosmic Beauty Death vs Sinister/Cooltrals/Smolder) and for a true sparkly red that stays red.
  - Practical queries: tools for water-activated liner; eye gloss creasing; shade comparisons; retailer/region access (UK demand for RdF).

## 6. Special insights

- Emerging Micro-Trends:
  - Grey lip era: grey balms, taupe liquid lips, cool brown-black glosses — consistently praised and purchased across posts.
  - Oil-slick lids as a staple: gelée/gloss textures (Crux) used alone or over smokey bases; acceptance of natural creasing for the payoff.
  - Fuchsia, no-glitter highlighter (Apparition) as daily-cool color glow — an antidote to icy silvers.
- Unexpected Pairings:
  - Lip oil over lip sheer for dimensional, comfortable depth (Hemlock + Midnight Glow).
  - Palette modularity: holiday palettes with swappable gradient singles to add inner-corner/brow-bone iridescents.
  - Metallic teal lip topped with green sparkle (Unearthly over Jolie “Earthly”) — editorial lips moving product.
- Creative insight:
  - “Medieval core” curation boxes are an opportunity: pre-bundled jewel tones + parchment neutrals + metallic accents with a narrative (Gawain/illuminated manuscript themes). Pair with gothic silver “armor” accessories content to drive cross-category AOV.
  - Winter pastels x graphic white: sell a “snowflake kit” (white water-activated liner, gem accents, long-wear shimmer liner) plus the right brush — users asked for brush recs.
  - Blurple mania has legs: dedicate an iridescent-violet/blue editorial page (Clionadh + Terra Moons + Blurples from palettes) with daylight/flash swatch toggles to answer “link?” and “how to buy?” friction quickly.
