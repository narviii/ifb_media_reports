# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key takeaway (Nov 24–30, 2025): Indie holiday launches and tarot/goth aesthetics dominated the week, with strong cross-creator momentum for Cosmic Beauty’s Death Tarot, DeDe’ Signature Festive Elegance, Lethal’s rebrand/Serpentine, and Kaleidos’ expanding lip ecosystem. Black Friday urgency plus improved US shipping from EU indies lifted purchase intent despite selective formula caveats.

## 1. Overview

The week felt like peak holiday hype: creators leaned into festive greens/reds/golds and cool-toned goth palettes, layering heavy shimmer/multichrome for maximal impact. Value talk was practical, not cynical—Black Friday stackable codes, gifts-with-purchase, and “last chance” restocks pushed conversion.

Texture talk centered on sparkly shimmers and multichromes (loved), and the real-world need for grip: glitter/shimmer primers became default companions. Lip narratives split into two strong lanes: glossy balm hybrids and stains for comfort/shine vs. early signs of matte’s comeback.

Eyeshadow dominated, but lips had outsized airtime via Kaleidos lip pencils/Lip Melts and Lethal’s new lip stains—creators showed specific shade combos and “popsicle” techniques, signaling ready-to-buy looks. Declutter content surfaced durability gaps in liquid toppers and non-magnetic singles, while Lethal’s BYOP tool and large magnetic palettes validated a singles-organization wave.

Indie-first sentiment stayed high; mainstream chatter skewed critical (e.l.f. concealer panned; novelty palettes mocked). EU indies addressing US shipping friction (US warehouses/restocks) was framed as a buying enabler.

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

Top mentioned indie products
- Cosmic Beauty (UK, US ship): Death Tarot Palette — strong, repeated positive performance notes (pigment, blendability, versatile cool-to-warm stories). One creator skipped for color-story redundancy; overall momentum high at launch.
- DeDe’ Signature (US/TX): Festive Elegance Palette — multiple creators praised the cohesive holiday story and matte performance; noted caveats: one broken shimmer on arrival; one matte needed building; “peacy” shimmer textures benefited from glitter primer.
- Lethal Cosmetics (DE, US warehouse): Serpentine Palette, Infinity Lip Stains, Slide Lip Balm, Singles + Palette Builder — rebrand well-received; lip stains called non-drying/long-wearing; palette praised for special finishes; BYOP return spotlighted.
- Kaleidos (CN): Lip Melts and new Lip Pencils — heavy, enthusiastic swatch content; “comfy gloss-balm hybrid” positioning resonated; multiple creators showcased lip combos; graphic liners and face gems from Moon Arcade fed a maximalist aesthetic.
- Unearthly: Dead Cute Palette — vibrant “spooky-cute” brights with strong payoff.
- Fantasy Cosmetica: Artificer Holographic Singles — collectible packaging + shift-heavy swatches; creator collab palette (Druid’s Familiar) paired with existing Druid signaled cross-usage value.

Sentiment trends and context
- Palettes: Mostly positive on performance/value; Cosmic Beauty and Lethal positioned as high-trust indies; DeDe’ Signature impressive for holiday, with practical app notes (primer, handling).
- Lips: Very positive on comfort (Kaleidos Melts; Lethal stains non-drying); rising enthusiasm for brown/cool-toned liners and stained “popsicle” looks; early matte return via ABH Lip Velvet chatter.
- Singles/multichromes: Strong desirability; organization and magnetization mattered. Repeat criticism: old liquid toppers drying out; non-magnetic pans reduce use.

Notable clusters
- “Lots of creators testing”: Death Tarot and Festive Elegance received multi-creator looks and swatches; Serpentine got dual sponsored/unsponsored coverage.
- “Default companions”: NYX Glitter Primer and Clionadh Shine-On became standard to manage sparkly textures.
- “Repeat criticism”: Liquid glitter toppers (older Menagerie shades) drying; “peacy” shimmers needing adhesive; non-magnetic singles get ignored.

Product combos creators tested
- Lip: Kaleidos lip liner (Hickory/Double Espresso/Merlot) + Lip Melt (Endgame/Checkpoint/Cypher/Pixel Storm) for glossy defined lips.
- Eyes: Clionadh Shine-On or NYX Glitter Primer under high-shine shimmers; white/colored graphic liners to frame festive and goth looks; pairing newer collab palettes with existing brand palettes for expanded color stories.

## 3. Category Trends

- Momentum categories: Eyeshadow palettes (holiday and occult/goth), lip liners + gloss-balm hybrids, lip stains; multichrome/special effect shadows; graphic liners; face gems for maximalist edits.
- Aesthetics/textures: Cool-toned resurgence (grays/blues/cool yellows), jewel-tone greens/reds/golds, goth tarot narratives; high-sparkle, glossy eyes; stained/glossed lips; occasional early-matte lip nods.
- Fatigue/skepticism: Glitter mascaras seen as costume-only; one creator criticized e.l.f. Satin Concealer; novelty kits (cookie-tin palette) dismissed.
- Seasonal shift: Clear holiday palette adoption with greens/reds/golds; “sparkle season” validated by primer use; face gems and graphic liner as festive accents.

## 4. Emerging Themes & Narratives

- Indie holiday dominance and cohesive themes (at least 3 creators): Death Tarot (Cosmic Beauty), Festive Elegance (DeDe’), and Serpentine (Lethal) framed as the week’s anchors; creators emphasized storytelling (tarot/serpentine/ornament motifs).
- Cool-toned comeback (multiple creators): Death Tarot positioned cool yet versatile; creators called out cool-leaning yellows and gray-blues.
- Sparkle with strategy (multiple creators): Glitter/shimmer adhesion management via NYX Glitter Primer and Clionadh Shine-On repeated; creators normalized “use a primer for these shimmers.”
- Lip layering culture (multiple creators): Liner + melt/balm combos and “popsicle” stain techniques drove how-to content; brown/cool-toned liners gained traction.
- Singles culture & customization (multiple creators): Lethal’s BYOP return and large magnetic palettes (Adept/Unearthly) matched with declutter content—magnetization and storage drive usage and sales.
- Declutter/curation realism (multiple creators): Aging liquids drying out, non-magnetic singles ignored—practical usage constraints shaping purchasing.

Regional momentum and brand-origin signals
- Western indie: Strongest visibility (US: DeDe’, Unearthly, Fantasy Cosmetica; UK: Cosmic Beauty; DE: Lethal). EU indies highlighting US shipping/warehouses reduced friction—a sales accelerator for US customers.
- C-beauty indie (Kaleidos): Lip ecosystem and liners resonating widely; maximalist accessories (face gems) adopted.
- Nordic indie: Oden’s Eye “last chance” messaging created scarcity-driven demand.

## 5. Purchase-Intent Signals

- Time-bound triggers: Multiple launch moments (Nov 28 drops) plus Black Friday stacking codes; “last chance” restocks (Oden’s Eye Hela).
- Trust levers: “Approachable pricing” (Cosmic Beauty), rebrand quality cues (Lethal’s weighted packaging, vegan/talc-free), creators calling brands “favorites.”
- Visual proof: Full-face looks and multi-angle swatches for palettes, lip pencils, multichromes; side-by-side comparisons reduced dupe anxiety.
- Problem/solution: Adhesion primers recommended for sparkly textures; US warehouses reduce tariffs and delivery risk.
- Basket builders: Lip liner + melt combos; palette + shimmer enhancer; BYOP singles plus large magnetic palettes/tools.
- Caution notes that still convert: DeDe’ shimmer needing glitter primer and occasional breakage reported, but overall palette enthusiasm stayed high; selective skip on Death Tarot for color-story redundancy by one creator didn’t dent broad hype.

## 6. Opportunities for the Store

Stocking priorities
- Eyeshadow palettes with active momentum
  - Cosmic Beauty Death Tarot (if distribution viable) or a comparable cool-toned goth palette with caramel/mustard accents.
  - DeDe’ Signature Festive Elegance; display with glitter primer add-on and protective packaging notes.
  - Lethal Serpentine and Singles (BYOP) if wholesale accessible; otherwise, mirror the trend with curated BYOP singles from compatible brands.

- Lip ecosystem (bundle-ready)
  - Kaleidos-style lip pencils (nudes to deep browns/berries) and comfy gloss-balm hybrids; merchandise as “liner + melt” sets with creator-inspired shade pairings.
  - Long-wear, non-drying lip stains to enable “popsicle lip” kits (liner + stain + clear/glow top).

- Effects and enablers
  - High-adhesion shimmer/glitter bases (NYX Glitter Primer, Clionadh Shine-On equivalents).
  - Graphic liners (white, shifty blues/purples) and face gems to attach to festive/goth kits.
  - Large magnetic palettes and magnetic tools/wands; position alongside singles to capture the organization trend.

Where demand is rising
- Cool-toned, story-led palettes with special finishes (multichrome/duochrome).
- Brown/cool-toned lip liners and stain-friendly toppers.
- BYOP singles with strong shifts; clear magnetization and storage solutions.

Where reviews are consistently negative or cautionary
- Older-style liquid glitter toppers with dryness risk; if stocked, set clear freshness windows and storage guidance.
- Non-magnetic singles/components that impede usage; prioritize magnetic-ready formats.
- e.l.f. Soft Glow Satin Concealer garnered a notable negative; avoid pushing as a hero item.

Merchandising and content
- Build creator-coded bundles: “Death Tarot cool goth eye kit” (palette + white graphic liner + shimmer base); “Festive Elegance holiday glam set” (palette + glitter primer + red/brown liner + sparkly melt).
- Promote “stackable savings” analogs (tiered bundles/GWP) to mirror Black Friday behavior outside sale windows.
- Educate with micro-guides: “When to use glitter primer,” “How to pair liners with melts,” “Singles: magnetization and palette planning.”

Operational/assortment notes
- Lean into EU indie distribution with US-based fulfillment to capture customers avoiding tariffs/delays; highlight this value in PDPs.
- QC/packing for shimmer-heavy palettes to mitigate in-transit breakage; offer parts credit or quick replacement to preserve goodwill.
- Track matte-lip inflection: add a small, curated matte liquid lipstick/velvet bullet edit (e.g., ABH Lip Velvet-style) without overcommitting.

Overall: center the store’s curation on indie narrative palettes, practical sparkle enablers, and lip layering kits that reflect exactly how creators are using products on camera.
