# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key takeaway: Week of 2025-11-24 to 2025-11-30 was driven by indie holiday drops and Black Friday urgency. Cool-toned, tarot/gothic palettes and comfort-first lip hybrids dominated creator attention, with multiple creators rallying around the same launches and codes.

## 1. Overview

The week felt like concentrated holiday hype with a decisive indie tilt. Creators pushed time-bound deals, restocks, and discount codes, pairing swatch-heavy previews with quick tutorials to convert urgency into sales. Swatching and “first look” content outpaced deep reviews.

Eye looks skewed cool, grungy, and sparkly: tarot/gothic cool tones sat alongside classic red/green/gold holiday stories. Texture talk centered on special-effect shimmers, multichromes, and the need for glitter adhesives/boosters to control fallout.

Lips were comfort- and technique-led: balm-gloss hybrids (“lip melts”) and non-drying lip stains were praised for shine, slip, and longevity. “Popsicle lip” (liner + stain + gloss) and liner+balm/gloss combos were repeatedly demonstrated.

Declutter/collection videos highlighted practical friction points: single-pan organization, non-magnetic formats, and aging liquid toppers drying out. “Sheer-buildable” face textures remained favored; overly pigmented/fast-drying cream bronzers and oily contours drew criticism.

A persistent meta-narrative: indie brands solving logistics for the US (US warehouses for Cosmic Beauty and Lethal), which lowers purchase friction during peak demand.

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

- Top indie launches with momentum
  - Cosmic Beauty (Cosmic Brushes) Death Tarot Palette
    - Sentiment: strong positive across Angelica, Heather, Battybean; one skip from Rachel (color story fatigue).

    - Hype position: early peak; became a default comparison point vs prior brand palettes (“not dupes” but distinct).
  - DeDe’ Signature Festive Elegance Palette + split-pan multichrome singles
    - Sentiment: broadly positive. Notes: one broken shimmer in PR; some shimmers benefit from glitter primer.

  - Lethal Cosmetics Serpentine Collection (palette, Infinity Lip Stains, Slide Lip Balm) + return of singles/palette builder
    - Sentiment: consistently positive (sponsored and non-sponsored). Lip stains praised as non-drying/long-wearing; balm packaging/luxe feel noted.

  - Reorganization of singles: magnetic palettes (Adept, Unearthly) and magnetic wands (Blend Bunny, Fantasy Cosmetica) spotlighted as solutions.
  - Product fragility/shelf-life: some Menagerie Moonlit liquid toppers dried out; older Sugarpill singles and ColourPop Super Shock called out as dry; non-magnetic loose multichromes (Game Beauty) underused due to format.
