## 5. Opportunities for the Store

- Stocking Recommendations:
  - Sparkle core: multichrome/iridescent singles and toppers (Terra Moons Leonids picks: Lovejoy, Celestine Dust, Leonid Spark, Helios Wake, Tempel), Shine By SD Forest Hues/Mystic Dreams (prioritize palette-cap bundles).
  - “Fall lip” bar: brown-chocolate glosses across tiers (luxury, mid, drugstore) + non-sticky gloss-stains for thin lips; include peptide/hydrating claims.
  - Holiday sparkle sticks and glitter mascaras: KIKO-style sticks; WAKEMAKE/affordable equivalents where KIKO is unavailable.
  - Cream/liquid cheek: Lawless cream blush, Armani Cheek Tint, Haus Labs Glassy Balm; glowy highlighters (Fire Opal tone).
  - K-Beauty base capsule: HERA cushion (glow + highlighter cushion), Jungsaemmool, TirTir (shade match guidance), Banila Co lip base; compact touch-up tools (mini puffs/brushes).
  - Sanrio tie-ins: Wet n Wild x My Melody/Kuromi lip/eye for giftable demand.
- Content Strategy:
  - Lean into:
    - 30–60s technique reels (glow without grease; “repair don’t prevent” crease tips).
    - Lip wear-tests for thin lips (non-sticky/gloss-stain hybrids) and liner swaps.
    - “Dupe matrix” shorts (Dior Blue Strobe, PMG Subliminal special shades vs indie singles).
    - Launch countdowns and “Link in first comment” discipline; region availability notes (e.g., KIKO).
  - Creator-collab spotlights with immediate swatches + on-face demos outperform flatlays.
- Gap Analysis:
  - Demand for non-sticky, long-wearing gloss that flatters small lips.
  - Accessible blue/green highlighters (Dior/MAC dupes) at drugstore and mid-tier price points.
  - Availability friction (KIKO in NA/BR); offer substitutes and shipping info.
  - Sparkle-safe bases/primers: carry and educate (Shimmer Stay/eye-safe glues; micellar removers for heavy sparkle).

## 6. Special insights

  - Two-tone lids and yellow–grey “smoky haze” with pinpoint glitter.
  - “Sparkle stick” comeback (KIKO Iced Daze, WAKEMAKE glitter stick) as fast, travel-proof toppers.
  - Pastel mattes that actually build (reports of improved formulas) paired with darker sparkly blacks.
- Unexpected Pairings:
  - Eyeshadows as face highlights and lip toppers (Terra Moons used on cheeks/lips); MOB Memento cream clay as blush.
  - Lip base blanking (Banila Co) before gloss—TV-ready lip technique creeping into everyday looks.
  - Lip liners as waterline liners (NYX Rebel Red); contour pens as lip liners (KJH Stylo).
