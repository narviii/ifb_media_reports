# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key Takeaway: All‑matte palettes paired with multichrome toppers defined this week, while moody “spooky season” color stories and blush layering drove concrete purchase intent across indie audiences.

## 1. Overview

Creators leaned hard into alt/goth seasonality: moldy greens, bruise‑tones, cherries/berries, and foggy blues. Excitement centered on indie launches and restocks, with frequent “use my code” CTAs and multi‑look tutorials that translate directly to basket builds.

Texture talk dominated. Multichrome/foil shimmers remained the hero but with caveats: several creators stressed tacky bases to prevent creasing and called out emollient shimmer formulas that slip on hooded/oily lids. In parallel, demand for comprehensive matte ranges grew; all‑matte frameworks were repeatedly praised as inspiring and functional.

Complexion chatter was blush‑heavy. Layering cream + powder (“blush sandwich”) and draping placement were shown in multiple shorts, usually in autumnal terracotta, nutmeg, and burnt‑rose tones. Lips skewed two ways: cushy, sparkly hybrid balms for shine enthusiasts and comfortable, moussey true‑mattes for vampy looks.

Value polarity was notable: a $128 pro‑priced multichrome palette drew raves from one authority while others opted out on price; meanwhile a viral jumbo drugstore primer generated mass‑appeal value buzz. Mainstream repackaging and oversized “2015” palettes were met with fatigue and skips.

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

- Blend Bunny x Mei Pang Rotten (all‑matte) + Efflorescence toppers
  - Sentiment: strong positive across creators; “top‑tier mattes,” unique “ugly cool” undertones; toppers seen as the ideal companion.
  - Context: matte base becomes canvas for toppers; grunge/decay theme resonates with season; inspires multi‑look content.

- Nomad Cosmetics Pacific Northwest
  - Sentiment: consistently positive; “one of Nomad’s best.” Easy mattes, high‑shine shimmers; earthy/mossy story fits fall.
  - Context: default comparison point for “moody nature” palettes; versatility highlighted in both quick looks and deep dives.

- Simply Posh Black Cherry
  - Sentiment: broadly positive; berry/rose story elevated by sparkly duos. Notes of crumbly/emollient shimmer from one creator, but another praised the drier, crease‑resistant shimmer feel.
  - Context: heavy swatch proof over tattoos; lots of creators testing it; becoming a seasonal cherry benchmark.

- Bella Beauté Bar Dark Dreamscape (palette, highlighter, Lip Sparkle Balms)
  - Sentiment: palette mostly positive with one mixed note on thinner light mattes; highlighter (“ethereal purple/blue flip”) and lip sparkle balms received repeated, enthusiastic praise (non‑gritty, comfy).
  - Context: heavy multichrome identity; frequent use of NYX Glitter Primer for payoff; lipstick/lip‑balm hybrids a standout.

- Singe Beauty Paisley Hoot + Evocative Lip Liners
  - Sentiment: positive; “interesting neutrals” (olive, mustard, white matte) and a standout multichrome (“Groovy”); liners compared favorably to higher‑end formulas.
  - Context: creator‑owned credibility; value flagged at $45; year‑round utility, not just fall.

- Danessa Myricks Lightwork VII
  - Sentiment: 10/10 from one authority; others excited or price‑cautious. Inclusion of mattes framed as solving last year’s cohesion gap.
  - Context: holiday limited model, 10 formulas, modular pans; high ticket but strong tech/texture narrative.

- Gourmande Girls Nevermore
  - Sentiment: positive; “grungy lover’s dream” with standout foiled shimmers.
  - Context: seasonal gothic storytelling; robust affiliate pushes.

- Oden’s Eye Hela (restock)
  - Sentiment: positive, urgency/FOMO‑driven.
  - Context: restock culture works; high‑contrast magenta/acid green looks showcased.

- Lethal x The Conjuring
  - Sentiment: mostly positive on palette/highlighter/primer; mixed on certain lip/setting powder items.
  - Context: IP done with detail; alt audience alignment.

- Unearthly Gothic Romance + liquid lips
  - Sentiment: very positive; palette called non‑biased favorite; liquid mattes praised as ultra‑comfortable “hyper‑matte.”
  - Context: gradient‑friendly color mapping; portfolio appeal beyond eyes.

Patterns:
- Clusters of creators testing the same indie palettes (Rotten, PNW, Black Cherry, Dark Dreamscape).
- “Matte base + topper” cited repeatedly as the working system.
- Repeat criticism around emollient shimmers creasing; tacky base framed as non‑negotiable.

## 3. Category Trends

- Eyeshadow
  - Momentum: all‑matte palettes with depth (Rotten) and “interesting neutrals” (olive/mustard/white) as core builders; topper/foil/multichrome companions standard.
  - Aesthetics: grunge/decay, cherry/dark romance, PNW moody nature, gothic/dark academia.

- Highlighter
  - Momentum: purple/blue ethereal shifts, “wet‑look” glow sticks, face‑highlight repurposing of eye toppers.
  - Fatigue: none flagged; instead, enthusiasm for specialty shifts.

- Lips
  - Momentum: sparkly balm/lipstick hybrids (non‑gritty, comfy) and deep vampy liquid mattes; lip‑combo culture (liner + gloss/balm) for autumn.
  - Seasonal shift: oxblood/burgundy and near‑black metallics embraced.

- Blush
  - Momentum: cream‑then‑powder layering and draping toward temples; shades: nutmeg, burnt rose, tomato/raisin.
  - Consumer driver: longevity + sculpt without bronzer.

- Prep/Tools
  - Momentum: glitter/tacky primers (NYX) as essential with flaky/foil textures.
  - Viral value: jumbo drugstore grip primer validated identical performance at extreme value.

- Fatigue/Skepticism
  - Repackaged mainstream duos/sets, oversized “everything base” complexion palettes, and small expensive matte-only quads/edits faced resistance.

## 4. Emerging Themes & Narratives

- Matte‑plus‑Topper System (cross‑creator): All‑matte palettes are positioned as the new backbone; iridescent/multichrome toppers complete the look. Adhesion strategy (glitter primer) normalized.

- Alt/Goth Seasonal Surge: Grunge decay, cherries/dark romance, and PNW woods dominate stories and thumbnails; IP tie‑ins (Conjuring, Wicked) reinforce the mood.

- Indie > Mainstream Creativity: Repeated praise for indie color stories, textures, and packaging; mainstream critiqued for repackaging and generic releases.

- Value Barbell: Pro‑priced texture tech (Danessa) vs viral budget value (e.l.f. jug) coexisting; shoppers self‑select by payoff/novelty vs quantity.

- Restock/FOMO Flywheel: Creator‑led collab restocks (Hela) and limited holiday drops drive urgency and “I’ll buy now” comments.

- Regional signals/brand origin momentum:
  - Western indie (US/Canada/UK/AUS/EU) dominates visibility: Blend Bunny, Nomad, Unearthly, Bella Beauté Bar, Singe, Fantasy Cosmetica, Gourmande Girls, Glaminatrix (US warehouse noted for access).
  - C‑beauty collabs (SheGlam) were praised for lore‑driven packaging in mainstream commentary—packaging as purchase driver even when performance is untested in‑video.

## 5. Purchase‑Intent Signals

- Strong buy cues:
  - “10/10,” “favorite of the bunch” (DM Lightwork VII; Unearthly Gothic Romance).
  - Multiple creators featuring the same SKUs (Rotten, PNW, Black Cherry, Dark Dreamscape).
  - Non‑gritty sparkly lip balms and ultra‑comfortable matte liquids repeatedly praised.
  - Restock urgency (Hela) and holiday limited drops (Lightwork VII).
  - Distribution wins (Glaminatrix via US warehouse) reduce friction.

- Conversion mechanics:
  - Affiliate codes plastered in titles/descriptions; short‑form swatch reels accelerate clicks.
  - Look recipes: palette + tacky base + topper; cream + powder blush; liner + gloss combos—encouraging multi‑item carts.

- Friction points:
  - Emollient shimmers creasing on texture/hooded lids without primer.
  - Perceived redundancy/price (Patrick Ta edits, repackaged mainstream duos); thin light mattes in some palettes.

- What to minimize/avoid
  - Large, all‑in‑one cream complexion palettes (low demand signal, negative sentiment).
  - Redundant small neutral edits at luxury prices without texture novelty.
  - Shimmer formulas that are overly emollient without offering guidance/tools; if stocked, pair mandatorily with adhesion bases and set expectations.

- Service levers
  - “Add the primer” one‑click upsell on any flaky/foil product.
  - “Build your blush combo” configurator with shade guidance by undertone/depth.
  - Seasonal fast lanes: “Hela‑coded” greens/magentas; “Rotten‑coded” grunge greens/maroons.

Overall, lean into the matte‑plus‑topper system, package seasonal alt aesthetics with practical adhesion tools, and double down on comfortable high‑impact lips and blush layering kits to capture the current indie‑driven demand.
