# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report
For the week of September 29 - October 5, 2025.

The week was defined by a surge of highly thematic indie brand collaborations, with spooky, gothic, and grungy aesthetics dominating creator excitement and driving clear purchase intent. This creative momentum from indie brands stood in sharp contrast to a more critical reception of repetitive, albeit high-quality, neutral palettes from mainstream luxury brands.

## 1. Overview

The energy across the YouTube beauty landscape was overwhelmingly focused on indie brands, driven by a powerful wave of creator collaborations and seasonal releases. The launch of the **Fantasy Cosmetica x battybean 'The Witch's Familiar'** palette was the week's main event, generating intense, positive discussion across multiple channels. This, along with releases from **Lethal Cosmetics (x The Conjuring)** and **Gourmande Girls ('Nevermore')**, solidified a market-wide shift toward moody, witchy, and cool-toned color stories for the autumn season.

This indie creativity was juxtaposed with a sense of fatigue surrounding mainstream releases. The new **Makeup by Mario 'Ethereal Eyes: Nature'** palette, while praised for its excellent formula, was met with skepticism regarding its originality, with several creators noting its similarity to previous neutral launches. This signals a growing consumer demand for novelty and unique color concepts over reliably safe, warm-toned palettes.

Aesthetic trends leaned heavily into grunge and alternative styles. The **Singe Beauty 'Paisley Hoot'** palette (70s-inspired) and the **Blend Bunny x Mei Pang 'Rotten'** palette (decay-inspired) were lauded for their unique, muted color stories. In application, the trend of layering high-pigment liquid blush under powder blush to achieve a dramatic, sculpted effect was repeatedly demonstrated.

Finally, industry logistics became a key talking point. The closure of Flower Beauty sparked conversations about the volatility of celebrity-fronted brands. In contrast, news of **Sigma Beauty's** expansion to Ulta and **Lethal Cosmetics'** new US warehouse were met with enthusiasm, highlighting that accessibility and ease of purchase are significant drivers of consumer interest.

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

-   **Fantasy Cosmetica x battybean 'The Witch's Familiar' Palette:** The undisputed star of the week. Universally positive sentiment across all mentions. Praised for its perfect execution of a "dark and witchy" theme, high pigmentation, and versatile color story (deep teals, purples, reds). Multiple creators showcased its performance, solidifying it as a must-have seasonal release.

-   **Singe Beauty 'Paisley Hoot' Palette & Evocative Lip Liners:** Generated significant positive buzz as a creator-owned brand launch. The palette was celebrated for its unique 70s-inspired "neutral with a twist" color story (olives, mustards). The lip liners received specific praise for filling a market gap with hard-to-find cool-toned taupe and ash shades. The brand's formula quality was consistently rated as "super high."

-   **Lethal Cosmetics x The Conjuring Collection:** Received positive reviews, driven by exceptional thematic packaging and strong product performance. The eyeshadow palette and 'Music Box' highlighter were standouts. Sentiment was mixed on the innovative but confusing 'Sanctified Seal' setting powder and the sheer finish of the black lipstick. The announcement of a US warehouse was a major positive signal, removing purchase barriers for a large market.

-   **Blend Bunny x Mei Pang Collection:** This collaboration was highly successful. The 'Rotten' all-matte palette was praised for its unique grungy color story and the brand's reliable formula. The 'Efflorescence' iridescent palette was a highlight due to its non-chunky, dry-touch formula that performs beautifully as a topper or highlighter.

-   **Bella Beaute Bar 'Dark Dreamscape' Collection:** Very positive sentiment. The multichrome highlighter was a standout, with one creator calling it one of the best purple highlighters they've ever tried due to its intense shift and lack of a grey cast. The new 'Dream Lip Sparkle Balms' were also praised for their comfortable, non-gritty, pigmented formula.

-   **Makeup by Mario 'Ethereal Eyes: Nature' Palette:** Sentiment was divided. The formula quality was universally praised as excellent—mattes are blendable and shimmers are reflective and smooth. However, multiple creators expressed fatigue with the warm-neutral color story, questioning its value at a premium price point. It appealed most to creators who specifically favor warmer tones.

-   **Rare Beauty Soft Pinch Liquid Blush:** Continues to be a creator staple. It was repeatedly used as a base layer for intense, long-wearing blush looks, confirming its status as a default product for high-pigment application techniques.

## 3. Category Trends

-   **Eyeshadow Palettes:** This category was entirely dominated by indie brands. Momentum is with thematic, unique color stories: witchy, gothic, grungy, and cool-toned palettes are driving excitement. There is palpable fatigue with expensive, standard warm-neutral palettes from mainstream brands.

-   **Blush:** The key trend is not a single product but a technique: layering a high-pigment liquid or cream blush as a base and setting/intensifying it with a powder blush. Application is focused high on the cheekbones and swept up toward the temples for a lifted effect.

-   **Highlighters:** Demand is strong for high-impact, color-shifting finishes. Multichrome highlighters that provide a visible shift without a dark or ashy base color are performing best.

-   **Lip Products:** Lip liners are gaining traction, particularly those in unique neutral shades (cool taupes, muted rosewoods) that are hard to find elsewhere. There is also interest in comfortable hybrid formulas, like pigmented balms, that offer color and moisture without feeling heavy or gritty.

## 4. Emerging Themes & Narratives

-   **Indie Collaboration Dominance:** Partnerships between indie brands and creators (Fantasy Cosmetica x battybean, Blend Bunny x Mei Pang) are proving to be powerful launch strategies. They generate authentic hype and leverage tight-knit communities, often outshining larger mainstream releases.

-   **Thematic & Seasonal Aesthetics are Paramount:** The most successful launches were deeply tied to a specific, well-executed theme. "Spooky Season" is in full effect, with witchy, gothic, and horror-inspired collections (Lethal, Fantasy Cosmetica) resonating strongly.

-   **Indie Formulas Setting Mainstream Trends:** Creators are now using indie quality as a benchmark for mainstream products. A high-sparkle Patrick Ta shadow was praised specifically because it mimicked an "indie sparkle formula," demonstrating that indies are leading innovation in texture and finish.

-   **Accessibility is a Key Purchase Driver:** The positive reactions to Sigma's arrival at Ulta and Lethal Cosmetics' US warehouse underscore that logistics matter. Removing barriers like high shipping costs, tariffs, and long wait times significantly increases purchase intent for international indie brands.

-   **Mainstream Repetition Breeds Skepticism:** Creators are becoming more critical of high-end brands releasing palettes with minor variations on existing neutral color stories. Even with excellent formulas, the lack of originality is a growing point of contention and a reason to pass on a purchase.

## 5. Purchase-Intent Signals

-   **Creator Collaborations:** The Fantasy Cosmetica x battybean palette generated the strongest purchase intent signals of the week. The direct connection to the creator, combined with the limited-edition nature, creates urgency.

-   **Problem-Solving Products:** Singe Beauty's cool-toned lip liners, explicitly created to fill a market gap, were met with immediate interest. Products that solve a specific consumer need show high potential for conversion.

-   **Unique Formulas & Finishes:** Strong positive reactions and "I would buy this" statements were tied to products with unique textures. The Blend Bunny 'Efflorescence' palette (non-chunky iridescents), the Bella Beaute Bar highlighter (intense, cast-free shift), and the Makeup by Mario palette's "wet look" shimmers all sparked significant interest.

-   **Nostalgia Marketing:** The Anastasia Beverly Hills 'Embers' palette is being purchased primarily because it is seen as a direct replacement for the highly coveted, discontinued Master Palette by Mario. This nostalgia factor is a powerful sales driver for collectors.

-   **Affiliate Codes:** The near-universal use of affiliate codes with indie brand reviews serves as a constant and effective call to action, directly encouraging viewers to purchase.

## 6. Opportunities for the Store

-   **What to Stock:** Prioritize highly thematic indie eyeshadow palettes with gothic, witchy, or grungy color stories. **Fantasy Cosmetica 'The Witch's Familiar'** and **Singe Beauty 'Paisley Hoot'** are clear indicators of current demand.

-   **Category Expansion:**
    -   **Highlighters:** Increase assortment of multichrome and duochrome highlighters, focusing on formulas without a dark base cast. The **Bella Beaute Bar 'Dark Dreamscape' Highlighter** is a prime example of what consumers want.
    -   **Lip Liners:** There is a clear, unmet demand for unique neutral lip liners, especially cool-toned taupe and ash shades. Sourcing these could attract a dedicated customer segment.

-   **Rising Demand:**
    -   **Layerable Blush:** Consider stocking both high-pigment liquid/cream blushes and coordinating powder blushes to cater to the layering trend.
    -   **Special Effect Toppers:** The excitement around the Blend Bunny iridescent palette indicates a strong market for versatile toppers that can be used on eyes and face.

-   **Where to Be Cautious:** Avoid over-investing in expensive, standard warm-neutral eyeshadow palettes. The market appears saturated, and consumer interest is shifting toward more unique and creative color stories offered by indie brands.

-   **Market Gaps:** The positive reception for Bella Beaute Bar's 'Dream Lip Sparkle Balms' suggests an opportunity for comfortable, hybrid lip formulas that deliver color, sparkle, and moisture without a gritty texture.
