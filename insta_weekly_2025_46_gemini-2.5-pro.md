# Weekly Instagram Beauty Media Landscape Report

*   **Key Takeaway:** For the week of November 10-16, 2025, the indie beauty landscape was dominated by highly anticipated new launches, particularly sparkly eyeshadow collections from Oden's Eye and Terra Moons. A distinct aesthetic split emerged between ethereal, cool-toned pastels and cozy, warm-toned grunge, while tutorial-style reels demonstrating these new products drove the highest engagement and purchase intent.

## 1. Overview

*   **The Vibe:** The feed was electric with newness. The week was heavily focused on launch-related content, with influencers dedicating multiple posts (swatch videos, tutorials, flatlays) to new collections like MOB Beauty's "Reverie," Oden's Eye's "Ice Crystal," and Terra Moons' "Night of the Leonids." Get-Ready-With-Me (GRWM) videos remained a powerful format for showcasing full looks and integrating new products with existing favorites.

*   **Engagement Temperature:** Audience sentiment was overwhelmingly positive and action-oriented. Comments were filled with excitement for new releases, explicit purchase declarations ("Ordered mine yesterday!"), and specific questions about product availability and performance. There was a strong sense of community, particularly around creator collaborations like MOB Beauty x Courtney Quarantine and the restock of Shine by SD x GlamSmitty.

The underlying looks were split between soft pastels and deep, grungy mattes (especially reds and blacks).
    *   **LIPS:** A strong preference for comfortable, glossy lips. Brown, mauve, and chocolatey glosses were prominent, often layered over a lip liner or stain for definition and longevity.
    *   **CHEEKS:** Cream and liquid formulas dominated. Brands like **Salt New York** and **Haus Labs** were frequently used to create a flushed, skin-like finish.

## 3. Aesthetic & Hashtag Trends

    *   **Cozy Grunge & Whimsigoth (#gothmakeup, #grunge, #altmakeup):** Characterized by warm, moody color palettes (ochre, magenta, deep brown), smoky eyes, and rich, chocolatey lips. This vibe was heavily influenced by the MOB Beauty "Reverie" collection.
    *   **Ethereal & Icy (#etherealmakeup, #sparklymakeup):** Driven by new winter-themed collections, this aesthetic featured cool-toned pastels (lilac, mint, icy blue), iridescent shimmers, and a "wet lid" look.

    *   **Icy Blues & Purples:** The Oden's Eye "Ice Crystal" palette set the tone for frosty, cool-toned looks accented with teal and iridescent shimmers.
    *   **Earthy & Warm:** Camel browns, golden ochres, and coppers were central to the cozy, autumnal looks inspired by the "Reverie" collection.
    *   **Vibrant Red & Teal:** A recurring high-contrast combination, particularly in graphic and two-toned eye looks.

## 4. Purchase-Intent Signals (From Comments)

*   **"Add to Cart" Energy:**
    *   **MOB Beauty "Reverie":** "I know youre trying to wait till 11:11 but I want it NOW. YESTERDAY." and "Ordered mine yesterday!"
    *   **Shine by SD x GlamSmitty Restock:** "Excited to pick up some of these!"

*   **Restock Demands:** The entire **Shine by SD x GlamSmitty "Forest Hues, Mystic Dreams"** collection restock was a major event, proving that limited edition, high-quality indie collaborations have long-term demand.

*   **Curiosity Clusters:**
    *   **K-Beauty Cushion Foundations:** Robert Welsh's roundup sparked a discussion on shade matching and performance on different skin types, with users asking for recommendations and sharing their own experiences.
    *   **Huda Beauty Blush Palette:** A comment ("I didn’t like the way they swatched on my hand. I would love to see it on u") highlighted consumer need for on-face demos to validate purchase decisions.
    *   **Salt New York Complexion:** Users asked for shade comparisons ("I’m struggling to pick between N13 and N12"), indicating interest but a need for more guidance.

## 5. Opportunities for the Store

*   **Stocking Recommendations:**
    *   **Prioritize Complex Shimmers:** The demand for sparkly, multichrome, and iridescent eyeshadows is at a peak. Focus on indie brands known for these special formulas (Terra Moons, Clionadh, Shine by SD).
    *   **Stock Dueling Aesthetics:** Carry both warm, grungy palettes (ochre, brown, deep magenta) and cool, ethereal palettes (icy blue, lilac, mint) to cater to the two dominant trends.
    *   **Expand Cream/Liquid Cheeks:** The preference for blendable, skin-like cheek products is clear. Stock cream blushes in popular pink and mauve shades.

*   **Content Strategy:**
    *   **Video is King:** Tutorial reels and GRWMs showing products in action significantly outperform static images. Prioritize this format.
    *   **Showcase the Sparkle:** Use video swatches (both on-arm and on-eye) to effectively demonstrate the unique shifts and sparkle of multichrome products. This is non-negotiable for this product category.
    *   **Problem/Solution Content:** Create content that addresses common makeup frustrations (e.g., "How to Touch Up Creased Concealer," "Best Blushes for a Natural Look"), as demonstrated by the high engagement on Robert Welsh's educational videos.

*   **Gap Analysis:** A clear gap exists between arm swatches and consumer confidence. Customers are skeptical of how a product will perform and look on the face, especially for cheek products. In-store and online content should focus on facial application across multiple skin tones to bridge this gap.

## 6. Special insights

*   **Emerging Micro-Trends:**
    *   **Multi-Use Shimmers:** Creators are increasingly using sparkly eyeshadows as lip toppers and face highlighters (e.g., `s.andromedae` using Terra Moons eyeshadow on lips and cheeks). This points to a desire for versatile, high-impact products.
    *   **"Medieval Core" Aesthetic:** A niche but visually potent trend seen in `ghoul.in.japan`'s content, featuring sallow, waxy skin tones and moody, desaturated colors inspired by historical art.

*   **Unexpected Pairings:**
    *   Creators are using products outside their intended categories to achieve specific results, such as using a matte lipstick for contour (`courtneyquarantine`) or a cream eyeshadow as blush. This reinforces the indie consumer's creative and resourceful nature.

*   **Creative insight**:
    *   **The C-Beauty Benchmark:** The "wet-look," high-sparkle, emollient shimmer formula popularized by Chinese indie brands is now the standard by which Western consumers and influencers judge quality. Danessa Myricks' Lightwork palette was praised specifically for achieving this C-Beauty-like texture, signaling a major shift in consumer expectations for luxury and indie shimmer formulas. Brands that can replicate this texture will have a significant market advantage.
