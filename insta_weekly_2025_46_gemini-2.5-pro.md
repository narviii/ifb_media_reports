# Weekly Instagram Beauty Media Landscape Report

*   **Key Takeaway:** For the week of November 10-16, 2025, the indie beauty landscape was dominated by major new launches and restocks, creating a dynamic clash of aesthetics. Ethereal, cool-toned sparkle from Oden's Eye and Terra Moons vied for attention against the warm, cozy grunge of the MOB Beauty x Courtney Quarantine collaboration, with video swatches and tutorials driving the highest engagement.

## 1. Overview

*   **The Vibe:** The feed was a flurry of launch activity. Content was heavily focused on showcasing new products through detailed swatch videos, GRWM-style tutorials, and high-quality flatlays. The primary narrative was one of discovery, with creators unboxing and providing first impressions of highly anticipated collections from indie darlings like Oden's Eye, Terra Moons, and MOB Beauty.

*   **Engagement Temperature:** Excitement was palpable and highly concentrated on newness. Comments were less about general compliments and more about specific purchase decisions. Followers were actively asking about launch times, comparing shades, and confirming their orders, indicating a highly engaged and ready-to-buy audience.

## 2. Product Momentum (Brand & Item Velocity)

*   **Top Mentioned Brands:** Huda Beauty, MAC Cosmetics, Oden's Eye, Terra Moons Cosmetics, MOB Beauty, Salt New York, Glisten Cosmetics, and Unearthly Cosmetics were consistently tagged and mentioned, appearing in a mix of indie and mainstream looks.

*   **Viral Products:**
    *   **MOB Beauty x Courtney Quarantine "Reverie" Collection:** This launch generated significant buzz, with creators and the brand showcasing the warm, grungy palette and "Linger" lip gloss. Audience comments show immediate purchase intent ("Ordered mine yesterday!").
    *   **Oden's Eye "Ice Crystal" Palette:** This holiday palette drove conversation with its icy, pastel-meets-neutral color story. Multiple creators posted swatch videos and photos, sparking follower excitement for the launch.
    *   **Terra Moons "Night of the Leonids" Collection:** This 14-piece shimmer collection created intense desire, particularly through mesmerizing video swatches that highlighted the shades' complexity.
    *   **Danessa Myricks Lightwork VII Palette:** A single video review by @ghoul.in.japan praising its "C-Beauty" like shimmer formula generated high engagement and international purchase inquiries.

*   **The "Look" Breakdown:**
    *   **EYES:** The focus was overwhelmingly on high-impact, dimensional shimmer. Iridescent toppers and multichrome eyeshadows from **Terra Moons** and **Clionadh Cosmetics** were used to create "wet look" lids. Cool tones (icy blues, purples, teals) were prevalent due to new launches, while bold matte red eyeshadow remains a strong, recurring statement.
    *   **LIPS:** A clear divide exists between two lip styles. The first is a soft, glossy nude-pink, often achieved with **Morphe's "Bubble Bath" lip liner**. The second is a deep, grungy look featuring chocolatey browns (MOB "Linger") and vampy reds/purples (Unearthly "Lore").
    *   **CHEEKS:** Cream and liquid formulas continue to dominate. The **Huda Beauty "Baby Pink" Blush Palette** and **Salt New York** cream blushes were featured in multiple looks, signaling a preference for blendable, skin-like flushes of color.

## 3. Aesthetic & Hashtag Trends

*   **Visual Themes:** The feed was a study in contrasts. **#gothmakeup** and **#grunge** aesthetics, characterized by smoky eyes and deep lips, were just as popular as **#etherealmakeup** and **#sparklymakeup**, which featured iridescent highlights and pastel shimmers. The emerging "rotting girl core" aesthetic, inspired by medieval art, presents a more artistic, avant-garde take on grunge.

*   **Color Stories:** Two primary palettes defined the week:
    1.  **Cozy Grunge:** Warm, earthy tones like camel brown, golden ochre, and deep chocolate (seen in the MOB "Reverie" collection).
    2.  **Icy Ethereal:** Cool-toned pastels, frosty blues, iridescent purples, and sparkly teals (central to the Oden's Eye "Ice Crystal" and Terra Moons launches).

## 4. Purchase-Intent Signals (From Comments)

*   **"Add to Cart" Energy:** Launch posts were flooded with high-intent comments:
    *   On MOB Beauty's collab: "Ordered mine yesterday!", "guess i’m gng to need this one too!"
    *   On Danessa Myricks: "I want this in India 😢"
    *   On Wet n Wild's collab: "i NEED the kuromi"

*   **Restock Demands:** The **Shine by SD x GlamSmitty "Forest Hues, Mystic Dreams"** collection restock was met with massive enthusiasm. The announcement and subsequent swatch posts confirmed significant pent-up demand for these specific multichrome singles.

*   **Curiosity Clusters:** The audience is actively seeking information and alternatives.
    *   **K-Beauty Cushions:** Robert Welsh's video on cushion foundations prompted users to share their own favorites and ask for recommendations.
    *   **Dupes:** Viewers are looking for affordable alternatives to high-end products, asking for dupes for Dior and MAC highlighters.
    *   **Formula & Performance:** Questions about the pigmentation of the Wet n Wild glosses ("Can you please try these on?") and the feel of lip products show a discerning customer base focused on performance.

## 5. Opportunities for the Store

*   **Stocking Recommendations:**
    *   **High-Sparkle Singles:** Prioritize multichrome and iridescent single eyeshadows with complex, shifty formulas. Brands like Terra Moons and Shine by SD are setting the standard.
    *   **Cool-Toned Palettes:** The demand for icy blues, purples, and teals is high. A well-curated winter or ethereal-themed palette would perform well.
    *   **Grungy Neutrals:** Don't neglect the demand for warm, moody tones. A palette with rich browns, ochres, and deep reds is essential.
    *   **Comfortable Lip Formulas:** There is a clear gap for lip products that are long-wearing but feel weightless and non-sticky, addressing creator and audience complaints.

*   **Content Strategy:**
    *   **Video is Non-Negotiable:** Reels showcasing swatches in motion are the most effective way to sell sparkly products. These videos had significantly higher view counts than static images.
    *   **Tutorials Drive Questions:** GRWM and tutorial videos that list all products used are highly effective for driving engagement and questions about specific items in a look.
    *   **Authenticity in Application:** Content that acknowledges real-world makeup challenges (like creasing or uncomfortable lip products) resonates deeply and builds trust.

*   **Gap Analysis:** Creator Lindsey Rowley's posts about her dislike for the feeling of most lip combos ("I give it 30 minutes before I wipe it off") highlights a significant market opportunity for comfortable, long-wearing, and low-maintenance lip products.

## 6. Special insights

*   **Emerging Micro-Trends:**
    *   **Artistic Faux Freckles:** The use of speckled cosmetic pens (Glisten Cosmetics) to create freckles in non-traditional shades like taupe and russet is a subtle, creative detail appearing across multiple looks.
    *   **"Medieval Core" Skin:** Influencer @ghoul.in.japan's "rotting girl core" look, featuring a waxy, yellow-tinged base inspired by medieval paintings, is a niche but visually arresting micro-trend pushing the boundaries of grunge.

*   **Unexpected Pairings:** Creators are repurposing products to achieve unique finishes. @s.andromedae used a **Terra Moons eyeshadow as a lip topper**, while @courtneyquarantine used a **MOB Beauty cream eyeshadow as a blush**. This signals a desire for multi-use products and creative experimentation.

*   **Creative insight**: The rise of C-Beauty as a benchmark for quality is a significant development. Influencers are now comparing high-end Western brands like Danessa Myricks *to* the innovative formulas of Chinese indie brands. This indicates a shift in the global beauty conversation and an opportunity to introduce and educate customers on C-Beauty brands known for their unique textures and intense sparkle.
