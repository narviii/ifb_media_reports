# Weekly Instagram Beauty Media Landscape Report

*   **Key Takeaway:** For the week ending November 16, 2025, the landscape was dominated by highly-anticipated indie launches, splitting the feed between cozy, grunge-inspired fall aesthetics and ethereal, icy winter looks. Tutorial and swatch-focused Reels drove the highest engagement, with audiences showing strong purchase intent for sparkly, multi-textured eyeshadows and comfortable cream base products.

## 1. Overview

*   **The Vibe:** A launch-heavy week fueled by PR campaigns from indie darlings like Oden's Eye, Terra Moons, and MOB Beauty. The content was heavily focused on product discovery through swatch videos, GRWM (Get Ready With Me) tutorials, and first impressions. The overall mood was a tale of two seasons: the warm, nostalgic grunge of the MOB Beauty x Courtney Quarantine "Reverie" collection contrasted with the frosty, ethereal pastels of the Oden's Eye "Ice Crystal" palette.

*   **Engagement Temperature:** High and action-oriented. Comments moved beyond simple compliments, with followers asking pointed questions about product availability ("Hope it comes to Beautylish"), expressing urgent purchase intent ("I want it NOW. YESTERDAY."), and tagging friends in launch announcements. Tutorial content, particularly from creators like Robert Welsh and Lindsey Rowley, sparked significant discussion around application techniques and product performance.

## 2. Product Momentum (Brand & Item Velocity)

*   **Top Mentioned Brands:** Huda Beauty, MAC Cosmetics, Oden's Eye, Terra Moons Cosmetics, Glisten Cosmetics, Salt New York, MOB Beauty, and Unearthly Cosmetics were consistently tagged across multiple high-engagement posts.

*   **Viral Products:**
    *   **MOB Beauty x Courtney Quarantine "Reverie" Collection:** This collaboration generated immense pre- and post-launch buzz. The "Linger" lip gloss and multi-texture eyeshadow quad were the focal points, with comments indicating immediate sell-out potential.
    *   **Danessa Myricks Lightwork Palette:** A single, high-engagement video (DQ8H5Wkk7Ki) by @ghoul.in.japan positioned this palette as a Western brand successfully replicating the coveted sparkly, emollient formula of C-Beauty brands, sparking significant interest.
    *   **Oden's Eye "Ice Crystal" Palette:** A coordinated PR push resulted in numerous swatch posts from creators like @sinireviews and @s.andromedae, building strong anticipation ahead of its November 15th launch.
    *   **Salt New York x Hannah Louise Poston Cream Quads:** Swatches and first impressions of these cream blushes and bronzers were well-received, particularly within the fair and olive skin-toned communities.

*   **The "Look" Breakdown:**
    *   **EYES:** The undeniable trend is high-impact, sparkly, and multichromatic toppers. Shimmers from Terra Moons, Clionadh, and the new Oden's Eye palette were used to create ethereal, "wet-look" lids. A strong secondary trend was monochromatic matte looks, particularly bold reds as seen on @s.andromedae (DQ4lJ27kaUa).
    *   **LIPS:** A focus on comfortable, glossy lips prevailed. Nude and brown glosses were popular, with creators building complex "lip combos" using multiple products. There's also a micro-trend of using shimmery eyeshadow as a lip topper for a metallic finish.
    *   **CHEEKS:** Cream and liquid formulas continue to dominate. The Huda Beauty "Baby Pink" Blush Filter palette and Salt New York's cream blushes were featured in multiple looks, demonstrating a preference for blendable, skin-like finishes.

## 3. Aesthetic & Hashtag Trends

*   **Visual Themes:** A clear split between two dominant aesthetics:
    1.  **#Gothmakeup / #Grunge:** Characterized by smoky eyes, deep vampy lips, and a muted, nostalgic color palette. The MOB Beauty x Courtney Quarantine launch heavily leaned into this (#whimsygoth, #reverie).
    2.  **#Etherealmakeup / #Sparklymakeup:** Defined by icy pastels, iridescent shimmers, and a "frosty" finish. This was heavily driven by the Oden's Eye "Ice Crystal" and Terra Moons "Night of the Leonids" collections.

*   **Color Stories:**
    *   **Icy Blues & Purples:** The primary color story of the week, featured in looks using the Oden's Eye and Wet n Wild x Kuromi collections.
    *   **Rich Reds & Grungy Browns:** A strong counter-trend, seen in monochromatic red eyeshadow looks and the cozy, autumnal tones of the "Reverie" collection.
    *   **Pastel Accents:** Soft pinks, mints, and yellows were used as pops of color, particularly in looks using the Simply Posh "Gingerbread Bakery" palette.

## 4. Purchase-Intent Signals (From Comments)

*   **"Add to Cart" Energy:**
    *   MOB Beauty "Reverie" Collection: "Ordered mine yesterday!", "guess i’m gng to need this one too!"
    *   Wet n Wild x Kuromi Gloss: "i NEED the kuromi," "I’ve been trying to get kuromi 🤞🏽"
    *   Shine by SD x GlamSmitty Restock: The announcement was met with a flood of "10!!!" (out of 10 excitement) and immediate interest.

*   **Restock Demands:** The entire narrative around the Shine by SD x GlamSmitty "Forest Hues, Mystic Dreams" collection was its limited return, driven by prior audience demand.

*   **Curiosity Clusters:**
    *   **K-Beauty Cushions:** Robert Welsh's breakdown of cushion foundations (DRAUfTREckC) prompted followers to share their own favorites and ask for recommendations ("My recent favorite is the clio kill cover mesh glow!").
    *   **Danessa Myricks Formula:** The comparison to C-Beauty formulas led to questions of global availability ("I want this in India 😢").
    *   **Affordable Sparkle:** Posts featuring Kiko Milano and Moira Cosmetics generated questions about where to purchase the products ("Where can you get it? I feel like i can never find kiko").

## 5. Opportunities for the Store

*   **Stocking Recommendations:**
    *   Prioritize multi-dimensional, sparkly single eyeshadows with complex shifts. Brands like Terra Moons and Clionadh are setting the standard.
    *   Expand offerings of cream and liquid blushes in buildable formulas, focusing on muted and dusty tones as seen in the Salt New York launch.
    *   Stock palettes that offer a variety of textures (e.g., matte, shimmer, sparkle topper) in one cohesive color story, mirroring the success of the MOB Beauty quad.

*   **Content Strategy:**
    *   **Video is Non-Negotiable:** High-quality swatch reels that clearly show texture and color shifts are the most effective sales tool for new eyeshadow launches.
    *   **Embrace the GRWM:** The "Get Ready With Me" format, which lists all products used for a full face, drives high engagement and broad product discovery.
    *   **Philosophical Tutorials:** Content that addresses a common makeup frustration (e.g., Robert Welsh on concealer creasing) builds authority and resonates deeply, outperforming simple application tutorials.

*   **Gap Analysis:** Creator @linsmakeuplooks's viral videos on the impracticality of lip combos for daily wear (DQ5Vb2yDgG4) highlight a significant market gap. Consumers desire the polished look of a "lip combo" but lack the time or patience for multi-step application and reapplication. This signals a strong opportunity for innovative, all-in-one lip products that deliver color, shine, and longevity with minimal effort.

## 6. Special insights

*   **Emerging Micro-Trends:**
    *   **Eyeshadow as Lip Art:** Creator @s.andromedae repeatedly used iridescent eyeshadows (e.g., Terra Moons' "Celestine Dust") as a lip topper over lipstick (DQ77hjaEUqM). This technique creates a unique, high-impact metallic effect not achievable with standard glosses, signaling a desire for more experimental lip textures.
    *   **Historical Art Aesthetics:** The "rotting girl core" look by @ghoul.in.japan (DRFUykbE9Lj), inspired by medieval paintings, shows a move towards more niche, art-history-driven aesthetics beyond generic "goth." This points to a more sophisticated and creatively demanding consumer.

*   **Unexpected Pairings:**
    *   Creators are repurposing products to fit their needs, using cream blushes and contour sticks as lip liners and even applying blush shades to the waterline for a cohesive, monochromatic effect. This behavior indicates a demand for multi-use products with versatile, eye-safe formulas.

*   **Creative insight:**
    *   **The C-Beauty Texture Takeover:** There is a clear and articulated demand for the sparkly, putty-like, high-impact shimmer formula perfected by Chinese indie brands. When a Western brand like Danessa Myricks successfully emulates this, it generates massive excitement. This is no longer a niche preference; it's becoming a benchmark for quality in the shimmer category.
    *   **The Shift from "Prevention" to "Repair":** Robert Welsh's highly-engaged video on accepting and touching up concealer creasing (DQ90lohinhY) marks a potential philosophical shift in the beauty community. It moves away from the heavy, "bulletproof" makeup of the past towards a more realistic, skin-friendly approach. This could drive demand for products that are easy to refresh throughout the day, such as hydrating mists and non-cakey touch-up powders.
