## 6. Special insights

- Emerging Micro-Trends:
  - Marble-stamped holo shimmer over dark bases (visually “wet stone” lids).
  - Red mascara accents with magenta halos.
  - Cool lavender/lilac blush on light-to-medium skin for lifted, icy cheek.
  - Jelly-texture highlights (stick/jar) for “sprinkled sparkle” that reads modern, not 2016.

- Unexpected Pairings:
  - Blue/teal lids + sheer nude gloss; vampy blurred stains with glassy skin.
  - Drugstore chrome hilites used as eyeshadow toppers (Wet n Wild as Kaleidos-adjacent).
  - Nose structure built with highlight placements instead of contour.

- Creative insight:
  - The “Angelic Grunge” bridge is here: pair airy pastels and holographic twinkle with goth lip stains and controlled matte zoning. Merch bundles that cross these aesthetics (icy eye kit + vamp lip + soft lavender blush + zone-mattifying powder) will meet both coquette and alt communities where they’re converging.
