# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key takeaway: For the week of January 26–31, 2026, creators rallied around two indie palette launches (Cosmic Beauty Angelic, Arttitude Moonlight Muse), pushed cool-toned/lavender cheeks and soft-glow bronzers, and doubled down on high-impact shimmers with adhesive bases. Complexion talk centered on thin textures vs. “greasy” glow and talc-free pressed powders.

## 1. Overview

- Eyes ruled the week. Multiple creators previewed or used pre-launch palettes (Cosmic Beauty Angelic, Arttitude Moonlight Muse), framing them as early spring answers to winter’s cool tones: pastels-with-depth, plummy smoky neutrals, and high-shine toppers.  
- Complexion coverage drew scrutiny. One GRWM flagged the “greasy” risk of luminous stick foundations paired with creamy concealers, countered by talc-free pressed powders and strategic setting. Across videos, creators favored thin, flexible base products and blurring primers that keep glow without slip.  
- Cheeks moved decisively cool. Lilac/lavender blushes (liquid plus powder layering) were positioned as modern, lifting, and “fun at any age.”  
- Lips leaned alternative: dark liners, cool brown/gray undertones, and iridescent gloss toppers. Lip combos were tight, reproducible, and indie-led.  
- A value-conscious undercurrent persisted: “shop your stash” disclaimers, mindful consumption talk, and multipurposing (blush pencils as lip liners). Yet affiliate-coded prelaunches created urgency and clear buy-paths.

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

Top indie products with momentum:
- Cosmic Beauty (Cosmic Brushes) Angelic Palette — strong, cross-creator push (Heather Austin, Angelica Nyqvist, Battybean); praised for pastel story with real depth; “buttery” mattes and sparkly shimmers. Pre-launch urgency (Jan 30) and discount codes amplified intent.
- Arttitude Cosmetics Moonlight Muse — repeated, highly visual showcases (Battybean) positioning it as cool-toned, plummy “spicy neutrals” with impactful shimmers; strong pre-launch pull (Jan 30).
- SINGE Beauty Succulent Dew + other SINGE palettes — recurring favorable mentions; viewed as versatile, colorful, and shimmer-reliable.
- Unearthly Cosmetics Made a Monster — applauded for neon-bright pink/purple payoff and standout shimmers.
- Bella Beaute Bar collabs (Ultraviolet, Pinky Promise) + Shimmer Stay primer — positive; pigment-forward mattes with layering-friendly, high-shine shimmers; primer repeatedly used to lock and pop toppers.
- Lethal Cosmetics Search for Squarepants — mixed: loved color story; shimmers called sheer and build-dependent.
- Fantasy Cosmetica Sorcerer + Divine Familiar — positive synergy demo; saturated mattes + reflective multichrome shimmer.
- MOB Beauty Cream Clay Shadows (M111, M141) — positive; blendable cool-toned bases for grunge looks.
- Half Magic Beauty Dopamine Sparkle Glitterpuck — positive; transformative topper that elevates matte smokey eyes.
- Rare Beauty bronzers — two separate creators praised the new powder launch (soft glow, smooth blend) and the Warm Wishes powder bronzer undertones (Sun Blaze’s yellow lean).
- Tarte Macaron Blush & Glow Duo (Honey Blossom) — “incredibly pretty,” fast sellout cues.
- Natasha Denona Hy-blush Lush Lila — mixed-to-positive: loved lilac tone; shimmer side less impactful than other shades.

Sentiment patterns:
- Palettes: largely positive for Cosmic Beauty, Arttitude, SINGE, Unearthly, Bella Beaute Bar; one repeat criticism around Lethal shimmer sheerness.
- Complexion: thin bases and blurring primers praised; luminous stick + warm concealer combo flagged as “greasy” without heavy setting. Talc-free pressed powders (Huda pressed Easy Bake) and affordable pressed setting (Glamlite) received positive utility mentions.
- Lips: indie liners/liquids/gloss toppers consistently positive; cool/gray undertones welcomed.

Context and hype cycle:
- Pre-launch visibility with clear dates and creator codes for Cosmic Beauty and Arttitude suggests near-term spikes and limited-window conversions.
- Cheek novelty sits with lilac/lavender and blush layering; Tarte duo in scarcity phase.
- Bronzer conversation consolidated around “soft glow, not flat matte” and undertone specificity.

Notable product combos:
- Dark liner + lighter center liquid lip (Black Moon Eerie + Menagerie Aurelia; multiple riffs).
- Off-label multipurpose: Kaleidos Blush Pencil as lip liner/base + Sugarpill iridescent gloss topper.
- Blush layering: ColourPop City Walk liquid + SINGE powder to set, boost, and shape.
- Palette pairing: Fantasy Cosmetica Sorcerer + Divine Familiar; Nomad + SINGE; topper-adhesive (Bella Beaute Bar Shimmer Stay) as a standard step.
- Base tuning: foundation + One/Size Base Thinner; heavy setting splits (Huda talc-free pressed vs. loose/other powders).

## 3. Category Trends

## 4. Emerging Themes & Narratives

  - Cosmic Beauty Angelic positioned as a pastel palette that includes deepening mattes; echoed by Noopur’s praise for tonal range in winter palettes and by Battybean’s positive Angelic look.
- Cool-toned, plummy “smoky neutrals”:  
  - Arttitude Moonlight Muse showcased multiple times; Noopur’s winter roundup reinforced cool/gray/plum desirability and the importance of non-black deep mattes.
- Sparkle/adhesive normalization:  
  - Multiple creators rely on shimmer adhesives/primers and topper-esque shimmers; high-impact, wet-look finishes expected from indie palettes.
- Texture-aware complexion:  
  - Two creators contrasted the pitfalls of greasy glow with thin, non-creasing alternatives and effective pressed powders; “blur but keep glow” is the target finish.
- Indie-first shopping and codes:  
  - Consistent affiliate-code framing and pre-launch dates across creators drive urgency; indie loyalty is visible and coordinated across US and UK brands.

Regional market signals and brand-origin momentum:

## 5. Purchase-Intent Signals

- Highest near-term intent:  
  - Cosmic Beauty Angelic and Arttitude Moonlight Muse (pre-launch dates, multi-creator praise, codes).  
  - Tarte Macaron Blush & Glow (glowing reviews + “sold out everywhere” language → restock demand).  
- Rising intent:  
  - Rare Beauty powder bronzers (soft glow finish praised across creators/shades); undertone specificity (yellow-leaning) drives matching purchases.  
  - Lavender blush SKUs (Natasha Denona Lush Lila noted as less shimmery but still desirable; layered liquid/powder approaches proliferate).  
  - Shimmer toppers and adhesives (Half Magic Glitterpuck; Bella Beaute Bar Shimmer Stay).  
- Replicable looks:  
  - Dark liner + lighter center lip combos (Black Moon + Menagerie) and off-label blush-pencil-as-liner pairings (Kaleidos + Sugarpill) encourage bundle buys.  
  - Blush layering duos (liquid + powder) tie directly to technique-driven purchasing.  
- Friction points:  
  - Overly luminous stick foundations + creamy concealers creating “greasy” outcomes; buyers will seek fixes (talc-free pressed powder, mattifying/blur primers, base thinners).

## 6. Opportunities for the Store

Stocking priorities (where demand is rising):
- Palettes:  
  - Pastel-with-depth and cool smoky/plummy stories. If direct brands aren’t available, align with:  
    - Simply Posh Snow Angel; Blend Bunny Longing; Nomad Chamonix Après-Ski; Bella Beaute Bar Realm of Fairies/Crystallize; Unearthly Made a Monster (for bold pink/purple).  
  - Ensure at least one palette with logical light/mid/deep gradients and non-black deep mattes (olive-friendly).
- Cheeks:  
  - Lavender/lilac blushes in both liquid and powder; offer pairable duos for layering (e.g., glowy liquid + luminous powder).  
  - Soft-glow powder bronzers with undertone options (especially yellow-leaning).
- Eye toppers and infrastructure:  
  - High-impact toppers (multichrome/iridescent glitters) plus adhesives/eye primers designed for sparkle payoff and hooded/oily lids.  
  - Cool-toned single shadows (grays/slate blues) and cream-to-powder formats (MOB-style).
- Lips:  
  - Cool brown/gray and mauve liners; velvet-matte liquids that don’t fully dry down; iridescent gloss toppers; lip oils with sparkle. Curate ready-to-use ombré kits.

Merchandising and bundles:
- “Pastel-with-depth Eye Kit”: palette + deepening matte single + adhesive + pastel waterline pencil.  
- “Lavender Cheek Stack”: liquid lavender blush + lavender-leaning powder + soft-glow highlighter.  
- “Alt Ombré Lip Set”: cool brown liner + lighter-center liquid lip + iridescent topper.  
- “Shine Control, Not Flat”: blurring primer + talc-free pressed powder + base thinner.

Address consistent negatives:
- Flag ultra-luminous stick bases as “pair with mattifiers” content-wise; recommend compatible powders/primers alongside.  
- For shimmer-sheer concerns (Lethal-like feedback), steer customers to toppers with instant payoff and publish “how to build” tips (adhesive, finger application).

Fill market gaps:
- Olive-undertone tagging: label “olive-safe pastels” and “non-ashy cool tones.”  
- Refillable/eco SKUs (MOB) to align with mindful consumption narratives.  
- Face embellishments (rhinestones/gems) and tools (precision brushes) to complete the celestial/fantasy looks.

Operational notes:
- Prepare inventory/cross-sells around announced launch windows; pre-bundle adhesives and eyeliners with new palettes.  
- Content/SEO: “pastels that don’t look ashy,” “lavender blush,” “soft-glow bronzer,” “talc-free pressed powder,” “hooded-eye sparkle that lasts.”

This week’s net: lean into cool-toned eyes with real depth, lavender cheeks, soft-glow bronzers, and sparkle-support infrastructure. Promote replicable combos and technique kits to convert high-intent, indie-loyal audiences.
