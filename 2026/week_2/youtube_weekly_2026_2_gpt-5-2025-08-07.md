# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key takeaway: Week of Jan 5–11, 2026 saw concentrated indie-palette hype led by Nomad Cosmetics’ Paris La Bohème launch build and Lethal’s SpongeBob reveal, alongside continued creator push for wet-look shimmers, layered blush, and value-forward complexion. These stacked signals point to strong near-term demand in eyeshadow, high-shine highlights, and blush pairings.

## 1. Overview

Indie dominated the conversation. Multiple creators rallied around Nomad Paris La Bohème with swatches, comparisons, and three-look demos; sentiment was uniformly strong on matte blendability and brighter, thinner, “not chunky” shimmers/multichromes. Lethal’s IP plays (Conjuring, SpongeBob) kept colorful palettes top of feed and broadened baskets with accessories (blotting papers, setting spray, brush set) that creators unexpectedly praised.

Texture talk stayed front-and-center: creators prioritized “wet-looking,” thin, high-reflect shimmers and icy/duochrome highlighters over glittery or chunky textures. Conversely, chunky shimmers and dusty mattes were a repeat drag on older or lower-tier palettes.

Cheeks are maximalist and layered. Multiple shorts showcased cream-then-powder blush stacks for saturation and wear, with deep berries and hot pinks placed high/draped. This contrasted with complexion preferences trending satin/hydrating and “blurred” rather than matte-heavy.

Value and access narratives resonated. Manny’s $5 e.l.f. concealer stress-tested well (medium coverage, wear, hydrating claims upheld), fueling budget-complexion interest. At retail, “Shop With Me” content spotlighted mainstream doors adding indie/influencer brands (Made By Mitchell at Ulta) and K-beauty expansion (d’Alba), plus tubing mascara proliferation.

Aesthetically, alternative/goth glam stayed influential (smoky bases + multichromes; vampy/dark lips; teal/green feature shades), while creators also leaned into cool pink/purple looks and spring-leaning brights in the Nomad narrative.

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

- Top mentioned indie products
  - Nomad Cosmetics Paris La Bohème (multi-creator coverage: Rachel, Angelica x2, Heather): universally positive on pigment, versatility, and thinner, brighter shimmers/multichromes; not limited edition; charity tie-in.
  - Lethal Cosmetics collabs:
    - The Conjuring palette (positive visual swatches).
    - SpongeBob Movie collection (Angelica, sponsored): strong praise for palette color story and surprise hits in accessories (blotting papers, fine-mist setting spray); Jelly Sticks noted as less pigmented than prior—easier control.
  - Clionadh Pick Your Potion (Heather): intense multichrome shifts; topper utility; positive comparison against prior topper palette (distinct enough to justify both).

  - Dede Signature From The Roots (Angelica): highly saturated swatches; jewel/earth mix; positive.

## 6. Opportunities for the Store

- Stock/Restock priorities (near-term):
  - Nomad Cosmetics Paris La Bohème: demand led by multi-creator endorsements; emphasize thin, sparkly shimmers and versatile mattes; reassure on non-LE restocks.
  - Clionadh Pick Your Potion: multichrome collectors; position vs previous topper palette as complementary.
  - Dede Signature From The Roots: high-saturation, jewel/earth story; leverage affiliate-driven buzz.
  - Fantasy Cosmetica Warlock + The Beast’s Familiar: promote as pairing set; show smoky + neon-lime looks.
  - Blend Bunny: Ellis Vol II (matte neutral companion) and Gel Liners (black + colors) for smoky-base builds.
  - Simply Posh Aurora Lights; Give Me Glow Vivid Rose; Klarity The Other Side; Ellis Atlantis Garden of Stars for multichrome/alt looks.
  - High-shine highlights: Dieverune Tinsel; consider “wet look” indie alternatives to Kosas to meet the texture demand without leaving the indie lane.

- Build bundles/kits
  - Smoky Multichrome Kit: black gel liner + multichrome palette + sticky shimmer base (e.g., Clionadh Shine On).
  - Blush Layering Duos: pair cream (Unearthly/Rare-style formulas) with pigmented powders (Adept/SINGE) in berry/pink.
  - Wet-Look Highlight Edit: icy/blue-shift and clear, high-gloss options (Dieverune; high-shine indie pressed).
  - Vampy/90s Lip Sets: deep liners (Black Moon) + gloss/glaze (Kaleidos) and brown liner + neutral lipstick pairings.
  - Companion Matte + Effect Shimmer: all-matte neutral (Ellis Vol II) bundled with a multichrome quad/palette.

- Assortment gaps to fill
  - Sticky shimmer adhesives/glitter glues (Clionadh Shine On or equivalent).
  - Blotting solutions and fine-mist setting sprays (if not Lethal, carry high-performing indie equivalents).
  - Tubing mascara option (indie or curated third-party) to align with the category trend.

- What to deprioritize or vet carefully
  - Cream cheek formats that remain overly emollient and lift base (avoid Tarte Macaron–style textures).
  - Palettes with chunky shimmer formulas and dusty mattes; avoid bulky, impractical packaging.

- Merchandising/content
  - Launch hubs with countdowns for key indie releases; “compare and choose” pages (e.g., Nomad Paris vs similar palettes).
  - Short-form demos: finger-pressed multichrome over smoky base; side-by-side blush layering; wet-look highlight under different lighting.
  - Promote creator-inspired looks (smoky teal; cool pink/purple/icy) with exact product maps to drive multi-SKU carts.

- Pricing strategy
  - Add a value tier for complexion basics (concealer/highlighter analogs in $8–$12 range) to capture the e.l.f.-driven interest while maintaining indie curation standards.

Overall: Lead with indie eyeshadow (storytelling palettes + effect shimmers), anchor with matte companions and gel liners, ride the blush layering and wet-highlight wave, and add utility accessories that solve for oil and wear.
