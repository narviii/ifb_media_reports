# Weekly Instagram Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key Takeaway: Jan 5–11, 2026 leaned icy, ethereal, and alt-grunge. Icy blue lids, wet-look (no-sparkle) highlights, and cool-toned lip architecture dominated; short, list-style tutorial reels and macro swatch breakdowns drove the clearest purchase intent.

## 1. Overview

- The Vibe:
  - “POV” and “round-up” reels: icy blues, charcoal shimmers, green–brown duochromes, and dark moody palettes.
  - Ethereal sparkle with editorial precision: wet sheen highlights, glassy lips, rhinestones/bows, colored mascara, and graphic elements (bubbles, spikes).
  - Alt beauty meets coquette: soft-goth grunge bases with baby-pink blush filters.
  - Launch build-up: Nomad Paris La Bohème swatches; Bella Beauté Bar “Pinky Promise” collab reveal.

- Engagement Temperature:
  - High enthusiasm on comparison reels (“Need them all,” “Add to basket”), strong Q&A energy (“Do you know a cobalt blue?” “Ulta recs?”).
  - Clear restock demand and LE frustration (Unearthly Dead Cute, Anthemy Snow Ferret).

## 6. Special insights

- Emerging Micro-Trends:
  - Gray “mixing” pigments to mute bright blush/base into dusty winter tones (Rituel de Fille Intuition).
  - Neon inner corner (acid green) contrasted with red/gray palettes (Lethal Serpentine).
  - Colored mascara (rose red) as focal accent on soft looks.

- Unexpected Pairings:
  - Blue lip liner (VB Jeans) topped with minty iridescent gloss (MAC Hint of Mint) for celestial ombré.
  - Black pencil in lip corners to “movie-grade” contour nudes/cool mauves without full dark lip.

- Creative insight:
  - Package a “Wet Not Glitter” bar: a cross-brand, skin-tone inclusive curation of wet-sheen, no-sparkle face highlights and lid toppers, plus the bases/brushes to get that glassy reflect with zero flake. Pair with creator-led demos comparing on fair/medium/deep skin to address the week’s biggest friction point (ashy payoff on dark skin).
