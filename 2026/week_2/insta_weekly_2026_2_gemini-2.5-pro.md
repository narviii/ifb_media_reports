# Weekly Instagram Beauty Media Landscape Report

*   **Key Takeaway:** For the week of January 5-11, 2026, the indie beauty landscape was dominated by cool-toned, ethereal, and grunge aesthetics, with a heavy emphasis on high-impact textures like intense shimmers and wet-look glosses. Tutorial-style reels and swatch roundups drove significant engagement, while conversations around custom color mixing and new palette announcements from Bella Beauté Bar and Nomad Cosmetics signaled key upcoming trends.

## 1. Overview

*   **The Vibe:** The feed was a dynamic mix of artistry and education. High-engagement video content focused on swatch comparisons (e.g., Smita Holden's "icy blue eyeshadow" roundup) and creative tutorials (e.g., Lindsey Rowley's "bubble makeup"). This was balanced by static, editorial-style images showcasing graphic liner and unconventional lip colors, particularly from creators like s.andromedae. A meta-conversation about the pressures of content creation also emerged, adding a layer of authenticity to the week.

*   **Engagement Temperature:** Audience sentiment was overwhelmingly positive and inquisitive. Comments were less about passive compliments and more about direct product questions ("What eyeshadow is that?"), purchase declarations ("*Adds to basket*"), and community-building (tagging friends). Tutorial videos from creators like Lindsey Rowley and Courtney Quarantine generated high view-to-like ratios, indicating strong audience retention and resonance.

## 2. Product Momentum (Brand & Item Velocity)

*   **Top Mentioned Brands:**
    *   **Unearthly Cosmetics:** Dominated with multiple mentions of the `Cursed Winter`, `Dead Cute`, and `Spring Magic` palettes, plus various lip products.
    *   **Huda Beauty:** A consistent staple in base routines, especially the `Easy Bake` powders and `Blush Filter` palettes.
    *   **Rituel de Fille:** Featured for its unique cream pigments, particularly `Intuition` and `Omen`.
    *   **NYX Cosmetics:** Maintained a strong presence in the affordable category with viral lip liners and new highlighters.
    *   **Danessa Myricks Beauty:** Frequently cited for versatile base products (`Yummy Skin Blush`, `Colorfix`) used by multiple creators.
    *   **MAC Cosmetics:** Remained relevant for staples like `24-hr eye base` and creative lip products.

*   **Viral Products:**
    *   **Rituel de Fille `Intuition` Cream Pigment:** Emerged as a key "mixing medium" used by creators to mute vibrant blushes into custom, cool-toned winter shades.
    *   **NYX Professional Makeup `Moonwalk` Lip Liner:** Repeatedly used in "grunge lip" tutorials for its cool, purple-gray undertone. The new `Lip Lingerie Stain` also generated significant "add to cart" energy.
    *   **Unearthly Cosmetics `Cursed Winter` Palette:** The go-to palette for the week's trending teal, green, and blue eye looks.
    *   **Bella Beauté Bar x @deandranicoleee `Pinky Promise` Palette:** The announcement of this collaboration generated massive excitement and anticipation, positioning it as a key launch to watch.

*   **The "Look" Breakdown:**
    *   **EYES:** The focus was on texture and cool tones. Looks were built around deep teals, icy blues, and charcoal grays, always topped with a high-impact, wet-look shimmer or multi-chrome. `Sheen Effect` and `Clionadh Cosmetics` were highlighted for their intense sparkly single shadows.
    *   **LIPS:** A strong resurgence of the 90s-inspired grunge lip. The formula: a cool-toned, slightly gray or purple liner (`NYX Moonwalk`) blended inward, with a touch of black liner in the corners, and finished with a clear or nude gloss. Editorial blue and green metallic lips also made a notable appearance.
    *   **CHEEKS:** Muted, desaturated blush was the dominant trend. Creators are actively mixing gray pigments into brighter blushes to create custom dusty mauve and cool-toned shades. Deep berry and plum blushes were also heavily swatched and featured.

## 3. Aesthetic & Hashtag Trends

*   **Visual Themes:** The feed coalesced around a "soft goth" or ethereal grunge aesthetic. Key hashtags included **#gothmakeup**, **#alternativemakeup**, **#graphicliner**, and **#etherealmakeup**. Looks featured diffused, smoky gray eyeshadow, sharp graphic liner, and unconventional lip colors, often paired with dewy, glass-like skin.
*   **Color Stories:**
    *   **Cool-Toned Dominance:** Icy blues, teals, mossy greens, and deep charcoals were the primary color story for eyes.
    *   **Vibrant Pinks & Purples:** A strong secondary trend, particularly in blush and monochromatic eye looks, fueled by the `Huda Beauty` blush palettes and the `Pinky Promise` palette announcement.
    *   **Muted & Desaturated:** The use of gray and taupe as mixers for both blush and lip color points to a sophisticated trend toward custom, muted tones.

## 4. Purchase-Intent Signals (From Comments)

*   **"Add to Cart" Energy:**
    *   The sponsored post for the **NYX Lip Lingerie Stain** immediately prompted a comment: "*Adds to basket*".
    *   Smita Holden's roundup of icy blue eyeshadows received comments like "Need them all it seems!" and "Omggggg i need them all."
    *   Lindsey Rowley's video on **ANUA**'s collagen patches sparked a direct call to action: "I need these right now @anua_global".

*   **Restock Demands:**
    *   **Unearthly Cosmetics `Dead Cute` Palette:** A user commented directly on a post featuring the palette, "Please restock Dead Cute palette😍".
    *   **Glaminatrix `Merry Chrissy` Palette:** Multiple comments expressed disappointment that the palette was sold out and wished for a restock, indicating unmet demand for popular limited-edition items.

*   **Curiosity Clusters:**
    *   **Lip Formulas:** High interest in the texture and performance of lip products, with questions like "What lip combo is this?" and praise for specific formulas ("Yesss the kaleidos lip melts are sooooo good").
    *   **Eyeshadow Texture:** Audience members asked specific questions about eyeshadow feel ("Are these on the Creamy side?") in response to swatch posts of `Sheen Effect` singles.
    *   **International Availability:** Frustration was expressed over brand accessibility, with comments like "Can’t get it in Australia 😢" on a NYX post.

## 5. Opportunities for the Store

*   **Stocking Recommendations:**
    *   **Prioritize Cool Tones:** Stock up on eyeshadow palettes and singles featuring icy blues, teals, greens, and moody grays/charcoals.
    *   **Feature "Grunge Lip" Bundles:** Create kits with cool-toned taupe/purple lip liners (dupes for NYX Moonwalk), black pencil liners, and high-shine clear glosses.
    *   **Invest in "Mixer" Pigments:** A gray or taupe cream pigment is a must-have. Market it as a tool for customizing blush and lipstick shades to achieve the trending muted look.
    *   **Anticipate the Pink Wave:** The upcoming **Bella Beauté Bar `Pinky Promise`** palette will drive demand for vibrant, deep pinks. Prepare supporting products in this color story.

*   **Content Strategy:**
    *   **"Swatch Roundup" Reels:** This format is a top performer. Create videos comparing multiple brands within a specific color category (e.g., "Our Top 5 Icy Blue Shimmers," "The Best Cool-Toned Nude Liners").
    *   **Tutorials on Micro-Trends:** Create content demonstrating how to use a gray pigment to mute blush or how to achieve the perfect grunge lip. This positions the store as an educational authority.
    *   **Static Editorial Shots:** High-quality, artistic photos of unconventional looks (like graphic lips) perform well for brand building, even with lower direct engagement.

*   **Gap Analysis:**
    *   A user complained about a **ColourPop** Super Shock Shadow being "crumbly with sooo much fallout." This is a clear opportunity to market alternative glitter and shimmer formulas as smoother, more user-friendly, and having less fallout.
    *   The recurring issue of international shipping and availability presents an opportunity to highlight brands with reliable global distribution or to create content around "dupes" for products that are hard to get in certain regions.

## 6. Special insights

*   **Emerging Micro-Trends:**
    *   **The "Muting" Agent:** The most sophisticated trend of the week is using a gray cream product (`Rituel de Fille Intuition`) not as contour, but as a mixer to desaturate and cool down vibrant cream blushes. This signals a move toward customized, complex cheek colors beyond off-the-shelf shades.
    *   **Graphic Ombré Lips:** Seen on `s.andromedae`, this involves using a bright, unconventional liner color (e.g., turquoise) to create a sharp, defined border around a softer, more neutral center. It's a fresh take on the ombré lip that feels more artistic and less blended.

*   **Unexpected Pairings:**
    *   **Eyeliner as Lip Liner:** Creator `s.andromedae` used the **Victoria Beckham Beauty `Jeans` Eyeliner** to create a deep blue ombré lip, showcasing product versatility.
    *   **Eyeshadow as Highlighter:** The **Sheen Effect `Night Elves`** shadow, a sheer blue iridescent, was specifically mentioned as a "blinding highlight," demonstrating the blurred lines between product categories.

*   **Creative insight:**
    *   **The Creator Authenticity Dialogue:** A notable undercurrent this week was the open discussion by creators like Amanda Hayden (`haydenhaunts`) about the tension between maintaining privacy and the platform's demand for personality-driven content. This vulnerability resonates with audiences and signals a potential shift away from hyper-polished "influencer" personas toward more authentic, art-focused content. This is a space for brands to support creators as artists, not just as marketing channels.
