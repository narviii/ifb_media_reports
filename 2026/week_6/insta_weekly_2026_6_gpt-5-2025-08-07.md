    - Fenty Wattab!*%# and Gloss Bombs (Whatabee/Wattabrat).

- Content Strategy:
  - Short, high-clarity swatch Reels and side-by-side comparisons (performed best for DR2 vs Magnetic Mineralia).
  - “Roundup by tone” Reels (vibrant pink chromes; glowy blues) drive saves/comments.
  - Micro-tutorials on one feature (hot lip combo layering; inner-corner glitter placement).
  - Education wins trust: primers (don’t set), powder “blur” myth-busting.

- Gap Analysis:

  - Access: EU/AU demand—mirror creators’ notes (Monolith EU drops; offer waitlist/notify-me).
  - Highlighters: Many using “impact” pans as eyeshadows—curate duochrome highlighters marketed for face/eyes to bridge.
  - Jelly stick availability: Add multiple brands at tiered prices (Joocyee, Catrice, Dose, Danessa) to capture curiosity.
  - Tools: Stock waxy, grip eye primers (MAC Paint Pot analogs); glitter adhesives; gentle makeup removers for sparkle-heavy looks.

## 6. Special insights

- Emerging Micro-Trends:
  - Charcoal/taupe/grey lips topped with sparkle balms; navy metallic lips reappear in editorial shots.
  - Red details beyond lipstick: crisp red graphic liner and visible red mascara.
  - Star stamps/sequin appliqués as “signature accessories” rather than one-off accents.

- Unexpected Pairings:
  - Duochrome highlighters worn as shadow (Clionadh Pitaya; BBB highlighter “as eyeshadow”).
  - ColourPop Rooftop Cocktails duochrome as cheek highlight on medium skin.
  - Sparkle balms layered over deep tints/liners for dimensional dark lips.

- Creative insight:
  - “Grunge Valentine” curation will outperform classic pink: merchandise bundles that pair chartreuse/yellow sparklers with mauve/olive mattes and a red liner/mascara accent. Add-on: star stamp + glitter primer. Anchor with a quick comparison Reel (DR2 vs Mineral/rock-inspired palettes) and a 30-second “how to drape blush into eyeshadow” clip to close the sale.
