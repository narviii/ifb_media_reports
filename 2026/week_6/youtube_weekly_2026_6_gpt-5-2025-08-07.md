# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key takeaway: For the week of Feb 2–8, 2026, indie eyeshadow palettes dominated creator attention, with Bella Beauté Bar’s Dead Roses Vol. 2 (launching Feb 9) and new Sparkle Balm shades driving clear pre-launch demand alongside a surge in UK indie visibility (Cosmic Brushes/Cosmic Beauty and Arttitude).

## 1. Overview

This week felt like peak Valentine’s “rose-goth” season: pinks, berries, and vamp tones were everywhere, often paired with high-impact sparkle toppers. Indie palette content was dense and upbeat, with multiple creators posting multi-look formats, ranking videos, and swatch parties.

There was visible creator enthusiasm for newness from smaller brands (Bella Beauté Bar, Cosmic Brushes/Cosmic Beauty, Arttitude, Unearthly, Blend Bunny) and repeated usage of sticky eye primers to maximize shimmer impact. Texture talk skewed to gel/bouncy and balm/toppers—on eyes and lips.

Complexion chatter leaned “grippy gel” and soft-matte/bouncy (Milk Makeup Hydro Grip Gel Concealer received organic praise; Rare Beauty’s new complexion adds were widely referenced via shopping videos and brand highlights). Value sensitivity surfaced around inconsistent listed pricing for Arttitude Moonlight Muse.

Mainstream skepticism targeted Makeup Revolution (reformulations and over-saturated collabs). Nostalgia/IP-led collabs still moved conversation (Lethal x SpongeBob, ColourPop x Twilight, Wicked Widow Rocky Horror).

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

- Top mentioned indie products
  - Bella Beauté Bar Dead Roses Vol. 2 (launch 2/9) and Sparkle Balm shade expansion: multiple swatch/looks, dedicated previews, and countdowns across creators (battybean, Angelica, Noopur); strong positive language (“dream,” “loving the vibes”), explicit launch timing, and code usage.

- Sentiment trends

  - Textures: multichrome/sparkle toppers; balm toppers for lips/eyes; gel/bouncy complexion formats.
  - Value/price: $45–$75 palette band accepted when payoff/curation is strong; confusion hurts Moonlight Muse momentum.
  - Hype cycle: Dead Roses Vol. 2 and Sparkle Balms are at peak pre-launch hype; Diabla is building via preorder content; Angelic is settling into “default comparison point” status for rosy/ethereal color stories.

- Notable product combinations creators used
  - Eyes: Dead Roses Vol. 2 layered over DeDe Cookie or Bella Shimmer Stay; Angelic + Gothic mixed for “angel-goth” looks.

  - Lip oils and sparkly balm toppers are surging (Bella Sparkle Balms; Unearthly Dead Cute Lip Oils; Merit/Gisou mentions in shopping content).

## 6. Opportunities for the Store

- Stocking priorities (immediate)
  - Bella Beauté Bar Dead Roses Vol. 2 and new Sparkle Balm shades: secure launch-day inventory and enable bundles (palette + Sparkle Balm + sticky primer).
  - Cosmic Brushes/Cosmic Beauty Angelic (and Gothic if available): maintain depth; promote as “angelic core” anchor with look guides.
  - Blend Bunny x Chanel Diabla: support preorder interest with clear ETAs and code promotions.
  - Unearthly Cosmetics Made a Monster; Gourmande Girls Bleeding Hearts: capitalize on sustained, positive multi-creator exposure.

- Attach and upsell
  - Primers that “lock shimmers”: DeDe Signature Cookie Primer and Bella Shimmer Stay. Create “Sparkle System” bundles with palette + primer + topper balm.
  - Vamp lip kits: curate combos mirroring creator looks (e.g., Black Moon liners + Menagerie Velvet Matte liquids + Unearthly lip oils). Offer swatch cards replicating battybean’s combos.

- Fill rising demand categories
  - Long-wear eyeliners: if Urban Decay isn’t carried, stock indie analogs (e.g., Ravie Beauty longwear, Glisten liners for brights; Gavissi water-activated as creative add-on) and position them as “24/7-style” solutions.
  - Gel/bouncy bases: consider carrying Milk Hydro Grip Gel Concealer if possible; if not, source indie/K-beauty gel-texture concealers and emphasize the “grip + blur” payoff creators highlighted.

- Messaging and merchandising
  - Seasonal curation: “Angelcore vs. Gothcore” storefront tiles featuring Angelic/Gothic palettes, Dead Roses Vol. 2, vamp lip kits, and sparkle add-ons.
  - Clarify pricing/value on Arttitude Moonlight Muse (address the noted discrepancy in copy). Add comparison swatches and shade story breakdowns to justify spend.

- Caution/ deprioritize
  - Avoid investing in Makeup Revolution cycles; creator skepticism is high and not aligned with indie positioning.
  - Monitor Byredo Vesuvio interest but expect conversion challenges at luxury price points; prioritize indie alternatives in similar color stories.

- Operational notes
  - UK indie procurement (Cosmic, Arttitude): plan for stock buffers and pre-announce restock dates—US demand is rising, and shipping lead times can bottleneck momentum.
  - Build rapid “looks library” content tied to each key palette (2–3 creator-inspired recipes per SKU) to harness search and speed conversion during launch windows.
