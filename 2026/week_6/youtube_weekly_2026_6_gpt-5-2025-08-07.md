# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key takeaway: Feb 2–8, 2026 was a decisive “alt‑Valentine’s” week: indie palettes with vampy/grungy color stories and wet‑look shimmers dominated creator attention, with Bella Beauté Bar’s Dead Roses 2 and Arttitude’s Moonlight Muse converting heavy pre‑launch interest into imminent buys.

## 1. Overview

Indie color moved the conversation. Creators leaned into gothic romance and cool‑toned purples/berries with grungy greens and high‑sparkle shimmers. The mood was maximalist and technique‑forward (shimmer layering, strategic mattes), with multiple creators explicitly pushing past “clean girl” minimalism.

Enthusiasm coalesced around a few standout palette launches/restocks (Bella Beauté Bar Dead Roses 2/Vol II, Arttitude Moonlight Muse, Cosmic Brushes Angelic/Gothic, Blend Bunny Diabla). Content skewed visual and short-form for swatches and “look recipes,” while longer formats ranked and contextualized formulas (Battybean’s roundup; Angelica’s 6 palettes/6 looks; Amy’s indie haul).

Texture talk was precise: “wet‑look” shimmers that are sparkly but non‑gritty; satins/soft metallics that don’t emphasize texture; refined multichromes over squishy/crumbly formulas. Utility mattes (a quality white, deep teals/purples) were flagged as “workhorse” shades.

Mainstream signals ran parallel: Rare Beauty’s Ulta rollout drove listicles and shop‑with‑me coverage; “reformulation year” (EU compliance) framed luxury complexion chatter (Armani, Dior). Fragrance spiked via budget collabs (e.l.f x H&M) and “creamy gourmand” body mists (Sol de Janeiro, Phlur).

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

- Top indie spotlights
  - Bella Beauté Bar Dead Roses 2/Vol II (multiple creators: Battybean, Angelica, Rachel, Noopur): strong positive for grungy/vampy story, creamy mattes, high‑impact but smoother shimmers; pre‑launch urgency (2/9). Sparkle Balms (incl. Deandra collab) also positively received for non‑gritty high shine.
  - Arttitude Cosmetics Moonlight Muse + Singles (Angelica, Battybean ranking, Rachel): positive; celestial, cool‑toned purples/silvers with intense multichromes; cited as top pick outside creator’s own brand.
  - Cosmic Brushes (Angelic, Gothic) (Battybean tutorials/bingo, Rachel): positive; angelic grunge aesthetic; deep mattes + ethereal shimmers; versatility highlighted by cross‑palette mixing.
  - SINGE Succulent Dew + Blushes (Battybean #1; Angelica usage): very positive; teals/purples/berries and glowy, non‑glitter blush finishes.
  - Unearthly Made a Monster + metallic lips (Battybean, Angelica; Rachel lip oils): positive; neon‑adjacent pinks, flaky/squishy shimmers needing wet application; metallic lip “Darkling” admired.
  - Blend Bunny Diabla (Battybean reveal; Rachel new releases), Surge (Noopur technique): positive; large format artistry gradients; “two‑step shimmer over matte” tip boosted perceived payoff.
  - Lethal Cosmetics: mixed. SpongeBob palette praised for mattes/color fun but repeat criticism that shimmers are too sheer; Conjuring setting powder panned (texture/balling). Infinity Lip Stains and nail polishes were positively received; Blood Drop primer mixed (gimmicky visuals, decent grip).
  - Milk Makeup Hydro Grip Gel Concealer (Battybean, Heather PR teaser): early positive for blendability/convenience stick format.

- Sentiment patterns
  - Consistently positive: BBB Dead Roses 2, Arttitude Moonlight Muse, SINGE Succulent Dew/Blushes, Cosmic Brushes Angelic/Gothic, Blend Bunny Diabla, What’s Up Beauty sophistiBALM (Rachel “Top Drawer”), About‑Face Illusionist Concealer (Rachel “Standout”).
  - Mixed/split: Urban Decay Tube Job Mascara (Battybean: underperformed after first use; Heather: “holy grail”), Lethal x SpongeBob palette (sheer shimmers), Buxom Flip Side (liner good, shadow sponge poor), Merit/ND complexion (great formulas but higher coverage than some creators prefer).
  - Negative: Freck Lashrocket liner (applicator/formula), Makeup Revolution Bouncy Blur Blush (dry/patchy), Lethal Conjuring Sanctified Seal (pilled).

- Context driving chatter
  - Performance: “wet‑look” high shine without grit; creamy deep mattes that blend on dark looks; shimmer payoff boosted over matte bases.
  - Novelty: IP collabs (Rocky Horror, SpongeBob), indie collabs (Diabla, Deandra), non‑AI illustrated packaging valued.
  - Value/positioning: Rare Beauty at Ulta (points), affordable luxury fragrance (e.l.f x H&M), indie multichrome superiority vs mainstream.

- Notable testing clusters
  - “Lots of creators swatching/using Dead Roses 2” across formats (full reviews, swatch shorts, launch guides).
  - “Moonlight Muse” repeatedly used as a cool‑toned celestial benchmark.
  - Repeat technique demo: shimmer layering over matched matte; utility of shimmer bases (BBB Shimmer Stay, Dede Signature primer).

- Product combos creators pushed
  - Lip stacks: Black Moon liners (Exhume/Underworld/Premonition) + Menagerie Velvet (Luna/Anthurium) or Unearthly metallics (Darkling); Kaleidos liner + Melt lipstick for neutral balance with colorful eyes.
  - Blush layering: Glaminatrix Kind Liquid Blush + SINGE Pretentious Plum for saturated, longer‑wear berry cheeks.
  - Palette pairing: Cosmic Brushes Gothic + Angelic in “palette bingo” to showcase complimentary depth/pastel contrast.
  - Shimmer base + multichrome: Bella Beauté Bar Shimmer Stay under indie sparkles.

## 3. Category Trends

- Momentum categories
  - Eyeshadow palettes dominate (multichrome‑forward, cool‑toned/vampy/grunge stories). Singles/multichrome toppers resurging.
  - Lips: dark liners + deep liquid/metallic lipsticks; glitter/sparkle balms and oils for high‑shine comfort.
  - Blush: liquid‑then‑powder layering; glowy satin finishes over glittery particles.
  - Eyeliners: long‑wear gel pencils praised (UD Liquid Stick Pencils); felt‑tip liners faced criticism.

- Aesthetics/textures
  - Cool‑toned purples/plums, swampy greens/olives, berry reds; “angelic grunge.”
  - “Wet‑look” shimmers and satins that don’t emphasize texture; refined multichromes; inner‑corner “pop.”
  - Metallic/deep lips returning in alt spaces.

- Fatigue/skepticism
  - Sheer/shifty shimmers that lack base pigment drew repeat critiques.
  - Drugstore misses (Makeup Revolution formulas; disjointed collab concepts) called out.
  - Packaging nitpicks (drawer palettes; wasted space; messy fingerprints) inform perceived value.

- Seasonal shift
  - From classic pink Valentine’s to “spooky/vampy romance.” Early spring “angelic/ethereal” pastels rising in tandem.

- Cool‑tone revival: Purples, teals, silvers become default comparison points (Moonlight Muse, Succulent Dew, Angelic).
- Multichrome, but refined: Preference for high‑sparkle, non‑gritty, smoother pick‑up; shimmer layering over mattes widely taught (Noopur, Battybean).
- Utility mattes matter: High‑quality white and deep teals/purples cited as elevating palettes (Angelica).
- Retail/Regulatory backdrop: Rare Beauty’s Ulta expansion fuels listicles; EU‑driven reformulations (Armani, Dior) normalize “new formula” cycles.

- Indie collab culture persists: Blend Bunny x Chanel Diabla, BBB x Deandra, Wicked Widow x Rocky Horror; hand‑drawn/non‑AI artwork appreciated.
- Regional momentum: Western indie dominance (US/UK/AU/CA). UK (Arttitude, Cosmic Brushes) and AU (Glaminatrix) visibility high; K‑beauty mentions present (Glow Recipe) but peripheral.
