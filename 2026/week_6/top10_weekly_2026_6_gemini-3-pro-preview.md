It was frequently described as a more muted, sophisticated successor to the original volume, with swatches demonstrating high pigmentation across deep reds, olives, and purples. Anticipation for the launch was a dominant theme, with multiple influencers showcasing it as a standout release for the week.

2. **Sparkle Balms by Bella Beaute Bar** — 10 mentions
   Often featured alongside the Dead Roses collection, these lip products were celebrated for their hybrid formula that bridges the gap between a lipstick and a balm. Creators like Noopur and Smita Holden highlighted the "Shooting Star" and "Dead Roses" shades, noting the formula provides high-impact sparkle without feeling gritty on the lips. The product was consistently commended for being comfortable, sheer yet buildable, and transformative when layered over liners.

3. **Made a Monster Palette by Unearthly Cosmetics** — 7 mentions
   This palette was favored for its vibrant, "pink-adjacent" color story that pairs fluorescent corals with deep, dramatic tones. Influencers utilized it to create alternative, high-contrast looks, specifically praising the variety of textures in the shimmers and the "attitude sassy" shade names. It was frequently cited as a go-to for creating complex, monochromatic pink and red editorial looks.

4. **Dead Roses Highlighter by Bella Beaute Bar** — 7 mentions
   Launching as part of the broader collection, this highlighter was described as "impactful" and "super shifty," with visible flips of pink, peach, yellow, and green.

It was repeatedly flagged as a unique, multi-purpose addition to the brand's lineup.

5. **Diabla Palette by Blend Bunny Cosmetics** — 6 mentions
   Collaborator Chanel Diabla’s palette was lauded for its "squishy" shimmer formula and intense pigmentation, particularly in the red and pink spectrums.

The packaging and "trippy" shifts of the shimmer shades were highlighted as major selling points.

6. **Magnetic Mineralia Palette by Dieverune Cosmetics** — 6 mentions
   This palette was championed for its unique, cool-toned color story inspired by rocks and gemstones. One creator, s.andromedae, reported hitting pan on multiple shades, citing it as a personal favorite for its "magnetic" hues and versatility in daily grunge looks. Comparisons were drawn between this and the Dead Roses palette, with creators noting Mineralia leans significantly cooler and more earthy.

7. **Moonlight Muse Palette by Arttitude Cosmetics** — 5 mentions
   Described as a "spicy neutral" palette, this product was praised for its mix of wearable neutrals and smoky plum tones.

9. **SpongeBob SquarePants Palette by Lethal Cosmetics** — 4 mentions
   Reception for this collaboration was mixed but prominent; while the "funky" color story and matte formula were appreciated, some creators found the shimmers too translucent compared to the brand's usual standard.
