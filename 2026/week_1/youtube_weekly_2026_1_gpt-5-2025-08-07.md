# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key takeaway: For the week ending January 4, 2026 (content dated Jan 1–4), creators leaned hard into alt-goth glam and “one-and-done” eye textures. Indie sparkle, liner-led ombré lips, and cool-toned palettes drove the week’s most convincing purchase intent.

## 1. Overview

Creators showcased high-impact looks built from simple steps: dark liner + pale center lips, liquid/cream shadow sticks topped with wet-look sparkle, and blush layering for locked-in saturation. The tone was practical and demo-first—fast, music-led reels that show payoff instantly.

“Wet metallic” and multichrome effects dominated eyes. Convenience narratives (“one and done,” travel-friendly, magnetic sticks, built-in brushes) cut through, while warnings surfaced around cream/liquid formulas cracking or creasing if overworked.

Alt/cool-toned momentum was clear: gothic lip constructions, cool greiges, blackened liners, and gray/berry/blue-leaning palettes ranked highest. Neutrals and warm-leaning mattes drew fatigue when they restricted creative range.

Seasonal signals: holiday sparkle persisted (chunky glitters, festive singles), while winter dryness pushed hydrating skincare mentions. Affiliate codes were ubiquitous and effective—creators positioned indie products with direct conversion hooks.

- Merit Solo Shadow creams — mixed: subtle/velvety but crease on oily lids.
- Gourmande Girls Mostly Merry palette — mixed/decluttered: “neutral-heavy” mattes dampen inspiration.

Hype/usage clusters
- “Lots of creators testing” high-sparkle singles and toppers (Dieverune, Oden’s Eye, Clionadh); these function as the default finish enhancers.
- “One-and-done” sticks are the convenience reference point (Danessa, Urban Decay, Bobbi Brown, L’Oréal).
- Repeat lip praise centers on liner formula quality and cool-toned shade availability (Black Moon, Blend Bunny).

Common product combinations
- Ombré goth lip: deep liner (Black Moon/Blend Bunny) + pale greige center (Melt/Black Moon) + glittery gloss topper.
- Eye impact stack: dark base > multichrome single > wet-look topper (Dieverune/Half Magic/Jolie liquid).
- Blush locking: liquid/cream blush (Glaminatrix) set with powder blush (Oden’s Eye).

## 3. Category Trends

- Lips: Liner-led looks surged—dark taupe/black/berry liners plus pale center or glossy sparkle. Opaque glossy blacks and sparkly balms saw enthusiasm; comfort and non-stickiness mattered.
- Eyes: Multichrome singles and glitter toppers are the finish of choice. “One-and-done” sticks/liquids sell speed and payoff; creators advise topper use to avoid cracking.
- Blush: Layering liquid under powder for a lifted, high-saturation cheek; hybrid/duo cheek products remain hot.
- Highlighter: Non-traditional shades (green tinsel) and ultra-reflect textures gained visible traction.
- Complexion: “New matte” and velvet-blur finishes praised; finishing/setting innovations (glass-melt sprays) used to balance glow and longevity.
- Seasonal: Holiday sparkle extends into January; hydrating skincare mentions rise due to winter dryness.

## 6. Opportunities for the Store

Stocking priorities (indie-forward)
- Lip pencils and goth lip builders: Black Moon and Blend Bunny—focus on cool taupes, deep plums/black, and greige companions; add a pale, cool nude center shade and a glitter gloss topper to enable the full look.
- Wet-look eye toppers and multichrome singles: Dieverune-style chunky glitters, Clionadh/Oden’s Eye-like shifts, Half Magic Glitterpuck equivalents. Curate hero shades (mint-silver, ethereal greens, dirty olives).
- Convenience sticks: Bring in Danessa Myricks Colorfix Stix; supplement with indie or K-beauty glitter sticks (e.g., Unleashia) to hit multiple price tiers.
- Cool-toned palettes: Stock goth/cool color stories (e.g., Blend Bunny Haunt Me analogs, Lethal Serpentine, Bella Beaute Bar Crystallized). De-emphasize neutral-heavy mattes for this audience.
- Novelty lip: Color-changing balms and sparkly lip balms (Bella Beaute Bar) as high-impulse add-ons.

Merchandising and bundles
- Grunge Ombré Lip Kit: deep liner + cool greige/pale nude bullet or liquid + micro-glitter gloss.
- Wet-Look Eye Stack: dark base (cream/liner) + multichrome single + pressed glitter/gel topper.
- Lifted Blush Duo: liquid/cream blush + tonal powder blush; include “how to place high” card.
- “Cool-Tone Edit”: quad/palette + liner + topper to serve the goth/romantic aesthetic.

Content and PDP improvements
- Short silent reels replicating creator combos; macro swatches under different lighting to show shift.
- Usage guidance: note that some liquids perform best as toppers; recommend primers to mitigate creasing on oily lids.
- Cross-sell prompts: “Complete the look” modules pairing liners with center shades and gloss toppers.

Caveats to stock lightly or clarify use
- Cream/liquid shadows with cracking/creasing chatter (R.E.M., Merit-like formulas): if carried, label as toppers or suggest thin layers and base/primer pairings.
- Neutral-heavy palettes: lower priority for this week’s visibly alt-leaning demand.

Seasonal add-ons
- Winter hydration upsell: include brightening/hydrating minis at checkout (toner pads/sleeping masks) to align with creator routines without diluting indie positioning.

Overall: prioritize alt-leaning, cool-toned color stories; enable quick, high-reflect looks; and package the exact combos creators are demoing to translate this week’s attention into carts.
