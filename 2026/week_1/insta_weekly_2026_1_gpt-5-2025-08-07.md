# Weekly Instagram Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key Takeaway: Jan 1–4, 2026 was icy, sparkly, and grunge-leaning: creators pivoted to cool-toned silvers, lavenders, and green-brown duochromes while short, tutorial-style reels and affordable sparkle roundups drove the highest engagement.

## 1. Overview

  - Tutorials returned: precise under-eye smoke, “mostly matte” looks, and specific palette walk-throughs.
  - Indie winter drops dominated visuals (Unearthly, Wicked Widow Rocky Horror, Girlcult capsule) with metallic lips and frosted/white lashes for an editorial winter finish.
- Engagement Temperature:
  - Excited and curious. Strong “where to buy/restock?” energy and shade-specific questions; followers tagged friends and requested more shades (true white shimmer asks, contacts comfort questions).
  - Clear purchase signals on themed collections and affordable sparkle; lifestyle GRWMs with full product lists pulled high views.

## 3. Aesthetic & Hashtag Trends

- Visual Themes:
  - #gothmakeup, #grunge/#softgoth meet #etherealmakeup: smoked charcoal sockets with celestial sparkle and frosted detailing.
  - Macro eye crops and editorial glitter tears; flatlays remain a craft (mood-driven props, narrative setups).
  - “Sparkle girl & no-makeup makeup can coexist”: co-sign for dual-aesthetic content.
- Color Stories:
  - Icy metallics: true silver, pale champagne-silver, blue-lavender iridescents.
  - Cool purples and mauves (including lavender-on-brown-skin).
  - Green-brown duochromes, khaki/olive accents; taupe/cool-neutral bases; occasional dirty gold.

  - “Best true white shimmer/glitter singles?” (follow-up request after silver roundup).
  - Contacts: comfort vs daily Rx vs non-Rx (OLENS explainer drove Q&A).

  - Lavender-on-Brown:
    - MOB x Niko lavender blush + gloss duo; add deep-friendly lavender liners/gloss toppers for pairing.

- Content Strategy:
  - High-performing formats to replicate:
    - “POV: you’re looking for…” roundup reels by finish/shade (true white shimmer, green-brown shifts, mauve lip wardrobe).
    - Tight, tool-forward micro-tutorials (under-eye smoke, frosted lashes without clump, glitter under-eye placement).
    - Macro swatch carousels with fair and deep arms; close-up lips for metal/duochrome.
    - Restock alerts with shade explainers and dupes matrix to catch “sold out” traffic.
  - Tone and education:
    - Maintain ingredient/texture notes (emollient vs powdery, particle size, topper vs opaque) and skin-tone behavior (e.g., olive undertones warming cool shades).

- Gap Analysis:
  - Complexion needs: multiple comments call for true olive foundations and cooler, non-orange bronzers; mature-skin friendly staples; fewer sheer-only launches; dusty/greige blush tones.
  - Transparency gaps: pressed glitter disclosures; shipping timelines; EU availability (e.g., Girlcult) where possible.
  - Provide smudge-proof waterline kits (pencil + sealant + application guide).

## 6. Special insights

- Emerging Micro-Trends:
  - Frosted/white lashes as a winter signature (seen with Glisten Spectra Lash), often paired with icy lids and glitter tears.
  - Metallic/duochrome nude lips rising alongside vampy purples—visible blue-violet flips over neutral bases.
  - Lavender across tones: not just pastel—validated on medium-deep skin in cream formats, often with mauve lip combos.

- Unexpected Pairings:
  - Eye glosses used as lip toppers (Rituel de Fille Pyxis); iridescent eyeshadows as face highlights (Terra Moons, Clionadh).
  - Mascara used on brows (Glisten Spectra Lash in blonde/white); cream “clay” formulas in the waterline (MOB m151).

- Creative Insight:
  - Package editorial “winter grunge” capsules:
    - Icy Smoke Set: true silver + blue iridescent topper + white lash + fine glitter + micro-liner brush + smudge brush + mini tutorial card (angle/pressure guide from Welsh’s method).
    - Lavender Lift Duo: cream lavender blush + cool mauve liner + lavender gloss; showcase on multiple skin tones.
    - Green-Brown Shift Stack: curated duochrome singles with base mattes (khaki/eggplant) and an eye-sealant for long wear.
  - Lean into coexistence messaging (“sparkle vs minimal”) to broaden appeal and reduce trend fatigue while keeping the sparkle front-and-center.

Notes on engagement:
- Highest resonance came from affordable sparkle (J.Cat), culturally themed indie capsules (Girlcult, Unearthly), and precise, utility-forward tutorials (under-eye smoke). Swatch-first carousels and macro close-ups remain conversion-friendly, especially when paired with restock notifications and clear texture guidance.
