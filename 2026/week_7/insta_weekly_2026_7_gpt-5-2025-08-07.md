# Weekly Instagram Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key Takeaway: Feb 9–15, 2026 skewed ultra-sparkly and alt: blue shimmer eyes and vamp/grey-brown lips led the feed, anchored by the Shine By SD x @glamsmitty Blue Hues launch and Bella Beauté Bar’s Dead Roses II; short tutorial Reels and swatch explainers drove the highest intent and saves.

## 1. Overview

- The Vibe:
  - Collab-heavy week with launch build-up, eye-swatches, and chrome “transformations.”
  - Tutorials split between complexion education (foundation blending, undertones, blush placement) and fast lip combo shorts.
  - Valentine’s content bifurcated: hot-pink Y2K glosses vs goth/vamp lips; blue sparkle cut through the holiday pink.
- Engagement Temperature:
  - Hot. Multiple “ordered/alarm set” comments for Blue Hues and “just bought” for Dead Roses II.
  - High Q&A under gloss/blushlighter posts (texture, shift, tone). Educational reels garnered gratitude and discussion.

- Restock Demands:
  - Not explicit, but “limited quantities” on Blue Hues + alarms set suggests rapid sell-through potential.

  - Texture/Formula: “Are they quite emollient or more dry?” (Blue Hues); “Are they gritty?” (sparkly glosses)
  - Shade nuance: “Difference…Fenty darker pink vs Fuchsia Flex?”; “lavender powder recs?”
  - Safety/comfort: Jcat plumping sting noted as strong
  - Technique: foundation “finger test,” undertone matching exercises, flexible blush placement

## 5. Opportunities for the Store

- Stocking Recommendations:
  - Sparkly Blue Eye Edit: Shine By SD Blue Hues or similar blue-leaning, holo-fleck shimmers; tacky base (Fyrinnae Pixie Epoxy) to pair.
  - Grungy Sparkle Palettes: Bella Beauté Bar Dead Roses II; Unearthly Made a Monster; Wicked Widow Rocky Horror; Byredo Vesuvio (lux alt).
  - Lip Bar Expansion: Grey stain (Glisten), vamp purple/rouge-noir bullets and lacquers (Chanel analogue), chocolate-brown creams, moody gloss toppers (Isamaya, Lisa Eldridge, NYX/Jcat at budget).
  - Glow Segment: r.e.m. cream blushlighters (non-sparkle sheen), Milk Shimmer Sticks, Cosmic Brushes blue highlight.
  - Base Tools: Melt Barely Blushing pink powder, Blurr Cream primer; puffs/flat brushes for press-and-push technique.

- Content Strategy:
  - Short, labeled eye-swatch reels (on-eye, placement overlays) and lip-combo shorts convert.
  - Side-by-side “save vs spend” complexion tests (MUA vs VB) drive debate and purchase.
  - Educational micro-lessons (undertone training, “push-in” foundation) outperform static content.
  - Launch journey/BTS assembly clips humanize indie drops and spark wishlist adds.

- Gap Analysis:
  - Customers wary of glitter emphasizing texture—curate finely milled sparkles and show “texture-friendly” application.
  - Demand for tinted setting powders (pink/lavender) with undertone guidance—bundle with quick undertone quiz or tutorial.
  - Plumping gloss sensitivity—offer low-tingle alternates and clearly mark sting level.
  - Packaging pain point (tiny cream pots)—prioritize user-friendly pan sizes for bronzer/cream color.

## 6. Special insights

- Emerging Micro-Trends:
  - Grey lip stain layered with pink/blue-shift gloss (grey + candy tones) as an alt-Valentine statement.
  - Blue highlighter as a daily cheek sheen (not just inner corner).
  - Bleached/colored lashes (Glisten Bleach/Soybean, Maroon) edging into mainstream looks.
  - Holographic speck inclusion in shimmers (callouts to “holo” flecks across Blue Hues).

- Unexpected Pairings:
  - Black eyeliner pencils repurposed as lip liners; ash-grey waterlines to cool down hot-pink eyes.
  - Warm metallics from luxury palettes used as luminous blush/highlight duos (Byredo/Viseart).
  - Lime/chartreuse inner corners with magenta lids—high-contrast focal point creators replicate.

- Creative insight:
  - “Palette hopping” (mixing 2–4 palettes per look) is creator-normal; shoppers follow this behavior. Merchandize micro-curations by color story (Blue Sparkle Capsule; Grunge Rainbow; Vamp Lip Wardrobe) across brands.
  - Blue is spring’s disruptor: position blue shimmer toppers and teal/cobalt singles as the season’s hero SKUs, not just pinks.
  - For conversions, pair every dry, high-sparkle formula with a recommended tacky base and a “finger vs brush” demo clip; it answers the top friction points before they’re asked.
