## 5. Opportunities for the Store

- Stocking Recommendations:
  - Sparkly blues and toppers: Curate a Blue Hues-adjacent edit—icy toppers, teal/cobalt metallics, hollow-fleck shimmers (Shine by SD, M81, MBA Prism, Sheen Effect; include tacky bases like Pixie Epoxy).
  - Grungy romance palettes: Bella Beauté Bar Dead Roses II (palette + highlight), Unearthly Made a Monster; pair with “sparkly balms” (BBB Cosmic Dust, Isamaya Ultraviolet).
  - Lip bar refresh:
    - Y2K pink gloss spectrum (Fenty Wattabrat, Half Magic Y2K Cherub, Kiko 48, Lethal Patch, ColourPop 2 Die 4, JCat Lust Boost).
    - Vampy bullets/stains and metallic darks (offer Chanel Rouge Noir-adjacent shades and alt-indie options).
    - Novelty/alt: Glisten Grey Lip Stain, deep berry stains, gradient kits (pale taupe liners + center-depth bullets).
  - Base and tools: Melt Blurr Cream + pink/lavender brightening powders; Milk Hydro Grip Gel Concealer; pro puffs and soft-blend brush sets (rephr/Singe); chrome flakes for high-impact toppers.

- Content Strategy:
  - Short, labeled eye-placement reels and lip-combo shorts convert best; pair with in-caption shade maps and shade names on-screen.
  - “Texture talk” sells sparkle: show finger vs brush, tacky base demos, indoor/daylight A/B.
  - Technique education (foundation “finger test,” blush placement freedom, undertone training) drives comments, saves, and trust—anchor with linked product kits.
  - Launch cadence: Pre-launch teases + giveaway + eye swatches + launch-day CTA mirrored Blue Hues’ conversion arc—replicate for future drops.

- Gap Analysis:
  - Demand for pigmented milky-pink glosses (less sheer); curate and test on deeper complexions.
  - Olive undertone solutions (concealers/foundations in true olive; undertone tools/content).
  - Texture-friendly luminous blush toppers beyond gold; cream options that don’t emphasize pores.
  - Ensure discount codes and checkout work at launch to avoid Wicked Widow-style friction.

## 6. Special insights

- Emerging Micro-Trends:
  - Blue inner-corner “icelight” paired with warm/grunge mattes.
  - Grey-stained lips layered with violet/UV gloss (editorial but wearable on-camera).
  - Stamp motifs (stars/hearts/bleach lashes) as micro-accessories for otherwise classic eyes.

- Unexpected Pairings:
  - Face highlighters as eye toppers (Fenty Wattabrat; Lethal Luminol outside-eye gleam).
  - Sparkly balms over lip liners/stains for dimensional “glass grime.”
  - Chrome flakes dropped on soft pink mattes—Valentine to villain in one tap.

- Creative insight:
  - “Dry, high-sparkle pressed” formulas are winning over “squishy” textures this week; position a “no-fallout sparkle” edit with tacky-base education.
  - Magnetic minis (curated 5-pans) resonate for both creators and shoppers—merchandise build-your-own sparkly quints by color story (Blue, Grunge Gold, Vamp Mauve).
  - Lean into “permission content”: creators’ push against strict rules (blush anywhere, mix multiple palettes) unlocks play—and baskets. Bundle “freedom kits” with mixed finishes plus tool/puff add-ons.
