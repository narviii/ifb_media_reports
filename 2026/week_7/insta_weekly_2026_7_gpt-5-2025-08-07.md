  - Y2K sparkly pink gloss tiered set: Fenty Wattabrat/Wattab (premium), Lisa Eldridge Peekaboo Pink (lux), Half Magic Y2K Cherub (mid), Kiko 48 & NYX She Got Money & JCat (value).

- Content Strategy:
  - 15–30s reels: labeled shade placement and eye/hand swatch macros (mirroring @s.andromedae and @glamsmitty) converted questions into buys.
  - “Shade showdown” shorts: blue shimmer toppers vs price tiers; pink gloss ladder with arm swatches (pin affiliate codes in first comment).

- Gap Analysis:
  - Warm/cool inclusivity in shimmer: feedback that silver reflects can wash out deeper skin—add rose-gold/peachy reflect toppers and demo with deep liners.
  - Cream blushlighters beyond gold: curate pink/mauve/cool champagne sheens to counter “all gold” critique on rem launch.
  - Brightening powders in lavender/pink: surface and compare undertone use cases.

## 6. Special insights

- Emerging Micro-Trends:
  - Grey lip stain as base for vivid/gloss toppers (pink/UV/blue) bridging goth and Y2K—ripe for kit bundles.
  - Blue holographic highlight accents (Cosmic Brushes) used as face/eye hybrid; blue inner-corner iciness resurging.
  - Holo-reflect indie shimmers: new Shine By SD holographic mica read as “extra special sparkle”; expect copycats.

- Unexpected Pairings:
  - Fenty Wattabrat highlight repurposed on eyes and paired with matching Gloss Bomb.
  - Chartreuse/yellow inner corners inside fuchsia/purple eye looks (grungy rainbow with contrast pop).
  - Black lip liner only at corners over brown/grey liners to sculpt 3D pout without full black outline.

- Creative insight:
  - Authentic GRWMs around mental health and lifestyle (med talk; “gaming-ready glam”) are pulling exceptional engagement; pair sensory-forward textures (squishy creams, chrome flakes) with calming, ASMR-ish demos.
  - Cross-culture style cues (Skullpanda aegyosal, bleached brows, blush-on-chin) are slipping into alt Western looks—fast, simple “borrow this detail” shorts can seed trend adoption.
