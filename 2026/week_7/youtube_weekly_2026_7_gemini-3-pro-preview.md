# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

- **Period:** February 9, 2026 – February 15, 2026
- **Key Takeaway:** The week was defined by a collision of aesthetics: a "2016 Makeup Revival" (heavy glam, cut creases) meeting "Valloween" (spooky/grunge Valentine's). Indie brands dominated share-of-voice, with creators explicitly noting that indie formulations are currently outperforming legacy mainstream brands in the eyeshadow category.

## 1. Overview

The beauty space this week felt like a rejection of "clean girl" minimalism in favor of artistry and pigment. A significant narrative, led by Angelica Nyqvist, focused on the return of 2016-style full glam, but with a 2026 twist: lighter base products replacing heavy foundations, while keeping the dramatic cut creases and bold highlighters.

Simultaneously, the "Valloween" (Valentine's + Halloween) aesthetic peaked. Creators like Battybean and Rachel Palmieri showcased deep berry, grey, and neon pink color stories, moving away from traditional soft romantic pinks. There is a strong "Alt-Girl" influence driving product choices toward grungy, cool-toned palettes.

Texture remains a critical driver. "Jelly" textures faced scrutiny (mixed reviews on Lethal Cosmetics), while "sparkle" and "multichrome" finishes continue to be the primary justification for high price points. Influencer skepticism was directed at discount retailers (TJ Maxx) due to expired products, reinforcing the value of buying fresh from indie brands.

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

### Top Mentioned Indie Products
*   **Blend Bunny "Diabla" Palette:** The clear winner of the week. Featured across multiple creators (Battybean, Rachel Palmieri) with high purchase intent signals. Praised for its versatility between ethereal and "edgy" looks and its "squishy" packaging.
*   **Bella Beauté Bar (Various):** The brand has high momentum. The **"Dead Roses"** collection (palette & highlighter) and **"Crystallize"** palette were showcased for their "goth-glam" aesthetic. The highlighter specifically was used to demonstrate "blinding" glow.
*   **Singe Beauty (Fearless Fig Blush & Succulent Dew):** Strong push on cool-toned purple blush. Amy Loves Makeup provided a dedicated tutorial proving its wearability, moving it from a niche product to a potential staple.
*   **Dede Signature "Sweethearts & Secrets":** Gained traction for its holographic packaging and high-pigment swatches.

### Sentiment Trends
*   **Positive:** **ShinebySD x GlamSmitty "Blue Hues"** (praised for texture/sparkle), **Merit Bronze Balm** (praised for blendability in natural looks).
*   **Mixed/Negative:** **Lethal Cosmetics x SpongeBob Jelly Blush** (criticized for patchiness and lifting foundation), **Morphe Brow Products** (quality control issues), **Holika Holika Devil's Plumper** (deemed too painful/unwearable).

### Context & Combos
*   **The "Lip Combo" Short:** A rising format where creators pair a dark liner (e.g., Kaleidos "Double Espresso") with a lighter center (e.g., Dose of Colors "Berry Me") to create a 90s/Ombré look.
*   **Sparkle over Matte:** Creators are using "topper" shades to modernize older matte looks.

## 3. Category Trends

*   **Eyes:** The market is demanding **Multichromes and "Wet-Look" Shimmers**. Standard shimmers are being critiqued as "dated" (seen in reviews of older Sigma/ColourPop palettes). "Eye Swatches" (applying to the lid rather than arm) are becoming the standard for proving value.
*   **Cheek:** **Purple and Cool-Toned Blush** is trending heavily. It is being positioned as a "neutral" for cool-toned eye looks.
*   **Complexion:** A split focus. One camp is doing "spot concealing" with dry-down techniques (high coverage, minimal product), while the other is using sheer skin tints (Merit). The common denominator is **skin prep** (serums/primers) over heavy foundation.
*   **Aesthetic Shift:** "Grunge Romance" — dark reds, greys, and berries mixed with neons.

## 4. Emerging Themes & Narratives

*   **Indie Superiority:** A recurring narrative (Rachel Palmieri, Angelica Nyqvist) is that indie brands have surpassed mainstream brands in formulation technology. Creators are explicitly stating that older palettes from big brands "don't hold up" against new indie releases.
*   **The "Drawer of Shame":** Influencers are creating content around reviewing backlogged PR. This highlights the saturation of the market; products that don't immediately grab attention are getting lost for months.
*   **Anti-Consumerism/Shop Your Stash:** Even within review videos, there is a "Palette Bingo" trend encouraging viewers to use random shades from their existing collection rather than buying new, unless the new product offers a unique texture (like a multichrome).

## 5. Purchase-Intent Signals

*   **High Intent:**
    *   **Cool-Toned/Purple Blush:** Viewers are being educated on how to wear it, lowering the barrier to entry.
    *   **"Standout" Palettes:** Products labeled as "Standouts" (Blend Bunny Diabla, Bella Beauté Bar Basic Witch) are driving intent over general "good" reviews.
    *   **Sparkle/Toppers:** High visual payoff in shorts/reels is triggering "I need that glow" sentiment.

*   **Low Intent:**
    *   **Jelly Blushes:** The negative reviews on the Lethal sponge-bob jelly blush may dampen enthusiasm for this specific texture category across brands.
    *   **Mainstream Reformulations:** Skepticism around "clean" reformulations of legacy products (e.g., Nars, Tom Ford) potentially altering performance.

## 6. Opportunities for the Store

*   **Stock Cool-Toned/Purple Blushes:** Demand is rising, and education is currently high on YouTube. If you have a purple or berry blush, push it now.
*   **Highlight "Topper" Shades:** Market single shadows or highlighters as tools to "modernize" a customer's existing palette collection.
*   **Curate "Grunge Romance" Bundles:** Group deep red lipsticks, dark liners, and cool-toned/grey eyeshadows. The "Valloween" aesthetic is currently more vibrant than traditional spring pastels.
*   **Avoid "Jelly" Complexion Products:** Unless the formula is foolproof, the current sentiment is wary of them lifting base makeup. Stick to creams and balms.
*   **Marketing Angle:** Use "high-performance" messaging. Align with the narrative that indie formulas are the "pro" choice compared to watered-down mainstream options.
