# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key takeaway: For the week of Feb 9–15, 2026, indie color launches dominated feeds with multichrome-heavy Valentine/“goth romance” palettes, while creators reframed the 2016 maximalist look with modern, lighter layers. Purchase intent clustered around a handful of indie palettes, alt-leaning lip combos, and high-shine cheek products.

## 1. Overview

- The week felt palette-forward and texture-obsessed: creators pushed multichromes, matte-with-sparkle, and crisp mattes, often pairing them with sticky eye bases and glitter primers to maximize reflect. Visual swatches and short, high-impact demos outperformed talky reviews.

- A “2016 but refined” narrative resurfaced. Creators embraced visible blush, cut creases, and bold highlight—but executed with thinner layers, stick formats, and better-blending modern formulas. The anti-“flattering”/pro-expression stance resonated.

- Indie brands were positioned as the shimmer-tech leaders; multiple creators contrasted newer indie formulas with older mainstream shimmers that now feel dated. Value talk split by category: price-sensitive in skincare and tools (TJ Maxx hauls), but willing to pay for standout indie palettes and alt lip textures.

- Fatigue/skepticism patterns: jelly blush formulas (patchy), painfully spicy lip plumpers, too-icy highlighters for wider tones, and complexion products that emphasize texture. Discount-retailer risks (expired pomades) were highlighted.

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

- Top mentioned indie products (sustained, positive buzz):
  - Blend Bunny x Chanel Diabla Palette: Repeated, positive usage (looks, swatches, packaging “squishy” callouts). Praised for blendable mattes, diverse shimmer textures; now a default comparison point in alt looks.
  - Dede Signature Sweethearts & Secrets Palette (+ singles Whispers, Love Spell): Heavy swatch-led promotion from multiple creators; strong claims on pigment and improved brand quality; holographic packaging boosted desirability.
  - Gourmande Girls Bleeding Hearts Palette: Strong “dark romance” positioning with high-impact swatches; leveraged for neon/graphic wings and moody looks.
  - Bella Beauté Bar ecosystem: Dead Roses Vol. 2 (grungy florals), Crystallize (cool-toned multichromes), Dead Roses Highlighter (duo/iridescent glow), and Sparkle Balms (balm–lip hybrid) all received glowing, repeated placement.
  - Lethal Cosmetics Serpentine and Lethal x SpongeBob: Serpentine praised for deep greens and metallic payoff; SpongeBob palette for pigment; jelly blush stick flagged negatively (patchiness).

- Additional momentum signals:
  - ShineBySD x GlamSmitty Blue Hues (single-shadow bundle): Eye-swatches emphasized multidimensional sparkle; blue-toned aesthetics rising.
  - ColourPop (Heart to Get vs. Eclipse): “Good for price” eyeshadows; Eclipse mattes preferred; shimmery blushes a highlight; “icy” highlighter divisive.

- Consistent critiques:
  - Older mainstream shimmer formulas (e.g., legacy Sigma/ColourPop palettes) feel behind current indie sparkle tech.
  - Jelly/novelty textures on cheeks perform inconsistently; extreme lip plumpers labeled unwearable.

- Product combos creators leaned on:
  - Eye: Matte depth + multichrome center + tacky base (NYX Glitter Primer/Bella Beauté Bar Shimmer Stay/Dede Sand Seal). Graphic liner and colored waterlines to frame looks.
  - Face: Purple/berry blush with rosy-toned “bronzer” or contour creams (not orange) for harmony; high-shine, cool-shift highlight.
  - Lips: Dark liner framing + bright center (berry/orange-red) for gradient/ombré; balm–oil hybrids layered over liners.

## 3. Category Trends

- Momentum categories:
  - Eyeshadow palettes: Alt-Valentine reds/berries/pinks, cool-toned neutrals, deep greens, and new blues. Multichrome and matte-with-sparkle textures are the draw.
  - Lips: Sparkle balms, lip oils, and alt lip combos (brown liner + berry or orange-red center).
  - Blush: Visible blush is back; purple/berry tones trend with technique education to de-intimidate. Shimmery blush resurges.
  - Highlighters: Duochrome/iridescent, high-shine finishes favored in alt looks (with “too icy” caveats).

- Texture/aesthetic gravitation:
  - Grunge/goth romance, graphic liner, cut creases, face gems, heavy shimmer gradients. Cool-toned revival (blues, greys, cool taupes) alongside Valentine pink/red stories.

- Fatigue/skepticism:
  - Jelly cheek textures (blend/patch risks), extreme lip plumpers, matte foundations emphasizing texture, and dated shimmer formulas.

- Seasonal shift:
  - Valentine’s energy (reds, pinks, vampy berries) blending into spring cool tones and blues; collectors pivoting from “holiday reds” to “cool glam.”

## 4. Emerging Themes & Narratives

- Cross-creator alignments:
  - Indie dominance in shimmer tech: Multiple creators framed indie palettes (Blend Bunny, Bella Beauté Bar, Gourmande Girls, Dede Signature, Lethal) as outperforming older mainstream shimmers.
  - 2016 maximalism reinterpreted: Dramatic eyes/visible blush return with modern, lighter-layer techniques; “anti-flattering” rules challenged.
  - Alt-Valentine/goth romance: Recurrent palette choices and looks (bleeding hearts, bitten, dead roses) signal ongoing demand for vampy, grungy romanticism.
  - Cool-toned comeback: Eclipse cool neutrals, blue-focused swatches, moody greens, greys; frequent blue/teal accents.
  - Technique infrastructure: Eye bases, glitter primers, and precision brushes are normalized as required to unlock multichrome payoffs.

- Regional market signals:
  - Western indie (US/Canada/UK) leads color momentum (Blend Bunny, Bella Beauté Bar, Gourmande Girls, Dede Signature, ShineBySD).
  - EU indie strength persists (Lethal DE; Nomad’s spring-leaning romantic palettes).
  - K-beauty: Skincare value (Banila Co cleanser wins) but color outliers (Holika Holika Devil’s Plumper) drew negative reactions; broader K-beauty retail expansion noted (BornToStandOut to Sephora).
  - C-beauty: Kaleidos lip formulas well-received in alt lip combos.

## 5. Purchase-Intent Signals

- High-intent clusters:
  - New palette launches with “available now” + affiliate codes + macro swatches: Dede Signature Sweethearts & Secrets; Gourmande Girls Bleeding Hearts; Bella Beauté Bar Crystallize; ShineBySD Blue Hues; ongoing Diabla push.
  - Explicit “standout/worth your money” endorsements: Bella Beauté Bar Basic Witch; Blend Bunny Haunt Me (still moving despite not-new).
  - Lip builders: Dark liners (Kaleidos, Lawless) + bold centers (Kaleidos Cloud Lab, Dose of Colors) + sparkle balms (BBB) drive easy add-ons.
  - Technique-led purchases: Eye primer/glitter glue and cut-crease/detail brushes recommended as performance unlocks; cluster lashes (Ardell) repeatedly praised.

- Cautionary signals (purchase deterrents):
  - Jelly blush formulas (patchy over base); extreme lip plumpers (pain); too-icy highlighters (limited wearability); discount-retailer brow pomades (expiration risks); matte complexion products that emphasize texture.

## 6. Opportunities for the Store

- Stock/Restock Priorities (high-conversion risk-adjusted):
  - Eyeshadow Palettes:
    - Blend Bunny Diabla (and maintain Haunt Me while momentum lasts).
    - Dede Signature Sweethearts & Secrets (plus singles Love Spell, Whispers).
    - Gourmande Girls Bleeding Hearts (Valentine/goth romance carry-through).
    - Bella Beauté Bar Crystallize; Dead Roses Vol. 2 if available.
    - Lethal Serpentine; ShineBySD Blue Hues (blue/cool-toned demand).
  - Cheeks:
    - Purple/berry blushes (e.g., Singe Fearless Fig analogues if distribution-limited) and shimmery blushes aligning with the visible-blush revival.
    - Duochrome/iridescent highlighters (e.g., Bella Beauté Bar Dead Roses Highlighter equivalents across tones).
  - Lips:
    - Deep brown and warm cinnamon liners; creamy, transfer-soft matte bullets and liquid lips in berry/orange-red; balm/oil hybrids; shimmer balms.
  - Enablers/Tools:
    - Eye bases and glitter adhesives (NYX-type + indie equivalents), precision crease/detail brushes, cluster lashes, face gems.

- Merchandising Bundles (capitalize on look-building behavior):
  - Alt-Valentine Kit: Vampy red/pink palette + grey/purple shimmer single + brown liner + berry liquid lip + glitter primer.
  - Cool-Tone Revival Set: Blue/teal singles bundle + cool-neutral quad + silver/icy topper + navy/teal liner.
  - Purple Blush Starter: Wearable purple blush + rosy-toned cream bronzer/contour + soft-focus setting powder + neutral lip liner; include application card (layering over creams, shade pairing).

- Content/Experience:
  - Quick technique guides on product pages (cut crease, “matte-with-sparkle” handling, purple-blush pairing).
  - Shade guidance for icy highlighters (alternatives by undertone) to reduce returns.

- Sourcing/Assortment Guardrails:
  - Avoid/limit: extreme lip plumpers marketed for “burn” effects; jelly blush formulas with poor base-compatibility; restocks of older shimmer-tech palettes unless reformulated.
  - Balance value and indie prestige: Add K-beauty cleansing balms (Banila Co or indie-adjacent equivalents) as entry-price skincare while anchoring color in indie leaders.

- Timing:
  - Ride Valentine’s afterglow into March with goth-romance and cool-tone bundles; support Diabla restocks/pre-orders and Dede Signature re-drops with waitlist capture.

- Upsell/Cross-sell:
  - Every multichrome palette page should auto-suggest: glitter primer, eye base, precision brush, and a coordinating liner; lip pages should suggest liner + balm/oil toppers.

This week’s data indicates that shoppers are primed to buy high-shine indie color anchored by enabling tools and technique education. Prioritize alt-leaning palettes and cool-toned expansions, pair them with the right primers/brushes, and package the experience so customers can reproduce creator looks with minimal friction.
