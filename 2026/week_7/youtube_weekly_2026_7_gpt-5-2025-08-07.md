# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key takeaway: Feb 9–14, 2026 content leaned hard into indie eyeshadow launches and “goth-romance” Valentine aesthetics, while creators framed a modern, higher-performance return to bold 2016-era makeup. Cooling neutrals, purple cheeks, and high-shine textures dominated purchase cues this week.

## 1. Overview

- The week had visible momentum around maximalist eyes: multichrome sparkle, graphic wings, and deep moody mattes. Creators positioned this as “2016 energy, 2026 execution” — bolder looks with less layering, better bases, and more refined formulas.

- Indie palette showcases and swatch-first shorts created urgency. Multiple creators pushed the same palettes (Blend Bunny x Chanel Diabla, Gourmande Girls Bleeding Hearts, Dede/DD Signature Sweethearts & Secrets, Bella Beauté Bar Dead Roses line), reinforcing performance credibility and collector appeal.

- Parallel tracks: value-driven discount hunting (Manny’s TJ Maxx) vs. premium indie artistry. Viewers were warned about expired/dated stock (mattes emphasizing texture; failed brow pomades; “painful” lip plumpers), steering spend toward vetted indie formulas and tools that make shimmers pop.

- Complexion talk split: glowy minimalist routines (Merit) remained relevant, but most excitement sat with cool-toned neutrals, icy highlights, visible blush, and high-impact shimmer toppers. Shade/texture nuance surfaced (e.g., “too icy” highlights; mattes-with-sparkle preserved by minimal blending).

- Seasonally, Valentine’s pivoted from soft pinks to “Valloween”/anti-Valentine: berries, greys, purples, and teal pops. Early spring cues: cool neutrals (ColourPop Eclipse), blue-toned sparkle singles (ShinebySD x GlamSmitty).

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

- Top mentioned indie products
  - Blend Bunny x Chanel Diabla Palette — cross-creator usage (battybean, Rachel) with repeated praise for matte blendability and shimmer payoff. Theme versatility (ethereal to edgy) made it a frequent benchmark.
  - Gourmande Girls Bleeding Hearts Palette — featured by Angelica (dedicated swatches, GRWM use) and battybean (rankings, bingo); lauded for vampy reds/pinks and reflective shimmers.
  - Dede/DD Signature Sweethearts & Secrets (palette + singles “Whispers,” “Love Spell”) — showcased via high-energy swatches and bold tutorials; noted brand formula improvements and strong mattes-to-shimmer pairing.
  - Bella Beauté Bar Dead Roses line — palette ranked #1 (V-Day), Volume 2 looks, Dead Roses Highlighter shorts, and Sparkle Balms woven through multiple looks; consistent “high-impact, grungy romantic” positioning. Rachel also flagged BBB “Basic Witch” as a standout formula.
  - Lethal Cosmetics Serpentine — repeated use (tutorial + roundup); praised for pigmented mattes and jewel-toned metallics; one shimmer “hard pan” caveat mentioned once.
  - ShinebySD x GlamSmitty Blue Hues — eye-swatch format spotlighted texture and sparkle; singled out as smooth, high-shine blues at an accessible price point.

- Sentiment trends
  - Strong positive: Blend Bunny Diabla; Gourmande Girls Bleeding Hearts; Dede/DD Signature Sweethearts & Secrets; Bella Beauté Bar (Dead Roses, Sparkle Balms, highlighter); Lethal Serpentine; ShinebySD Blue Hues.
  - Mixed: ColourPop Heart to Get gloss (too icy shade); ColourPop Change Me Highlighter (very icy); Sigma Cor de Rosa older shimmer formula (feels dated vs. current indie shimmers); BareMinerals BarePro (cakey/texture-emphasizing); Kara Beauty cream blush (pretty but can disrupt base); Laura Geller Wearables (mattes/blush good, shimmers sheer).
  - Negative: Holika Holika Devil’s Plumper (painful/unwearable); Morphe brow kit (chunky/possibly expired); Pixi Brow Duo (packaging failure).

- Context and hype cycle
  - Performance-led momentum: creators repeatedly proved blendability of deep mattes and the adhesion/flash of multichromes on-eye (not just arms).
  - Shimmer tech as a differentiator: multiple creators argued indie shimmer/multichrome formulas outpace older mainstream palettes; “dated shimmer” is a red flag.
  - Price/value: codes “BATTYBEAN,” “ANGESCHKA,” “RACHEL” normalized; TJ Maxx bargains highlighted but undercut by spoilage risks — pushing serious buyers back to reliable indie DTC.
  - Aesthetics: “dark romance,” grunge-glam, and alt Valentine storylines concentrated interest.

- Notable product combos tested
  - Glitter/tacky primers + shimmer toppers (NYX Glitter Primer; Bella Beauté Bar Shimmer Stay; Dede Sand Seal).
  - Brown liner + berry/magenta lips (Kaleidos Double Espresso + Dose of Colors Berry Me).
  - Sparkle Balms paired with varied liners for dimensional lips (Bella Beauté Bar).
  - Shadow sticks/bases to intensify payoff (ColourPop Shadow Stix; Urban Decay liners).
  - Purple blush harmonized with rosy/cool bronzers (Singe Fearless Fig + Salt New York Old Gum).

## 3. Category Trends

- Eyeshadow dominates: multi-look tutorials, eye-swatch reels, and rankings concentrated on palettes with moody reds/berries, greys, teals, and blues; mattes-with-sparkle and multichromes preferred.
- Blush: visible, cool-leaning shades (purple/lavender) framed as wearable via technique and undertone pairing; shimmery blushes (ColourPop Super Shock) praised.
- Highlighters: high-shine/iridescent, often cool/icy; desirability high but “too icy” can split audiences.
- Lips: ombré/90s liner revival; shimmered balms; berry cores over deep brown liners.
- Tools/primers: adhesive/tacky bases are now “default kit” for indie shimmer success; brush specificity called out (precision cut-crease tools).
- Seasonal shift: from Valentine’s pinks to alt “anti-Valentine” and early spring cool neutrals/blues; collectors chasing thematic drops and collabs.

## 4. Emerging Themes & Narratives

- Modernized 2016 revival (Angelica + multiple alt creators by practice): bold cut-creases, visible blush, and bright highlight — but with thinner layers, cream sticks, and refined blending to avoid cakiness.
- Indie formula leadership (Rachel + battybean + Angelica): repeated claims that indie shimmer tech outperforms older mainstream formulas; older palettes feel dated.
- Goth-romance/Valloween across creators (battybean, Angelica, Rachel): moody reds/purples, greys, and teal pops; “dark romance” packaging and storytelling drive engagement.
- Primer-first shimmer culture (battybean, Rachel, Heather): glitter/tacky bases and shadow enhancers are table stakes to unlock multichrome payoff.
- Value-savvy skepticism (Manny + Rachel): discount hunting has appeal, but creators caution on expired/poor-performing stock; buyers are being coached where to spend vs. skip.
- Regional/brand-origin signals:
  - Western indie surge: Blend Bunny (US), Bella Beauté Bar (US), Gourmande Girls (US), Dede/DD Signature, ShinebySD (Canada), Lethal (Germany) all with strong visibility and positive sentiment.
  - K-beauty mixed: Banila Co cleansing balms celebrated for value; Holika Holika plumper rejected for discomfort.
  - Mainstream collabs still move attention (Lethal x SpongeBob; Wicked Widow x Rocky Horror; ColourPop x Twilight), but purchase intent centers on indie performance.

## 5. Purchase-Intent Signals

- Highly convincing swatch/demo content: eye-swatch and macro sparkle shots (ShinebySD Blue Hues); on-eye multichrome gradients; “available now” plus codes.
- “Standout” declarations and rankings (Rachel’s Standouts: Bella Beauté Bar Basic Witch; Blend Bunny Haunt Me. Battybean’s #1 Dead Roses and top-5 placements for Bleeding Hearts/Diabla).
- Technique-led confidence builders: tutorials showing cut-crease tools, bases for shimmers, and how to wear purple blush reduced buyer hesitation.
- Price/value levers: indie discount codes normalized; TJ Maxx bargains spiked interest in K-beauty cleansing balms — but creator caveats may redirect higher-intent buyers back to new, fresh indie launches.
- Early/ongoing hype: Blend Bunny Diabla and Gourmande Girls Bleeding Hearts are becoming default comparison points; Dede/DD Signature’s formula improvement narrative builds trust; Bella Beauté Bar’s Sparkle Balms/highlighter gain repeat usage.
