# Weekly Instagram Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key Takeaway: Jan 19–25, 2026 skewed cool and sparkly: icy blues, lilac shimmers, and true holos took center stage alongside moody goth smokey eyes and Valentine heart motifs. Audiences showed clear buy-now energy for affordable chromes and indie blue capsules, while tutorial reels and swatch carousels drove the strongest engagement.

## 1. Overview

  - Heavy on swatches and macro sparkle: multiple capsule drops (Terra Moons Veil of Winter Skies, Singe Beauty Succulent Dew, Wet n Wild Chrome singles) plus detailed eye swatches and macro shimmer close-ups.
  - Tutorial-forward reels: quick hacks (liner anchoring with pinky, halo-eye blueprint, nose-foundation fix), filter-to-face recreations, and lip-combo demos.
  - Dual lanes in aesthetics: frosty winter glam (icy blues/lilacs, diamond toppers) vs. alt/goth (black smokey, graphic white liner, colored mascara, black/berry gloss).

- Engagement Temperature:
  - High intent on affordable standout textures (Wet n Wild Chrome: “Ordered as soon as they went live,” “Sold out at my Walmart”).
  - Indie capsules converted: “Ordering mine now” (Singe), “Placed my order” (Singe), “Just bought it” (BBB collab), “Just ordered mine” (Gourmande Girls).
  - Curiosity-driven Qs: fallout/eye safety, holo vs. standard shimmer, lab vs. hand-pressed formulas, availability (Canada/US), complexion depth for blushes.

## 5. Opportunities for the Store

- Stocking Recommendations:
  - Sparkle toppers and holos: icy/blue/lilac multi-size glitters and true holos akin to Terra Moons Ice Flare/Polar Ion and “diamond toppers.”
  - Affordable chromes: Wet n Wild–like single pans; secure inventory anticipating sell-outs (offer purple chrome option).
  - Lip stains/tints: juicy, high-shine deep berries/blacks/oranges; pair with non-sticky gloss toppers.
  - Detail tools: white liquid liners/marker sticks, star/heart stamps, colored mascaras (teal/purple), burgundy/wine liners.
  - Glow cheeks: cream-to-powder blushes with sheen (Moira-like), silk-finish powders (Singe-like), jelly/prism highlighters (blue/iridescent).
  - Goth-aligned palettes + Valentine pinks/grunge hybrids; magnetized palettes for custom quads.

- Content Strategy:
  - Short, actionable reels: liner anchor with pinky; halo-eye in 3 shades; nose primer-toner fix; gray lip-liner contour for any lip.
  - Macro eye/lip swatches under varied lighting; “diamond topper” on bare vs. base comparisons.
  - Shade comps and undertone guidance (e.g., lilac toppers across price tiers).
  - POC face-swatch features for blush/highlight depth questions.
  - Seasonal bundles: “Frosted Goth” kit (black smokey basics + icy topper + berry/black gloss + star stamp); “Valentine Noir” (pink graphics + white liner + mauve nude lip + sparkle topper).

- Gap Analysis:
  - Curl-holding mascara need: stock J-beauty waterproof curlers (Heroine Make) and educate.
  - Availability gaps: offer Canada-accessible chromes; import-friendly alternates to Girlcult.
  - Pressed-glitter aversion: prioritize sparkly shimmers/holos without sticky bases.
  - Complexion depth: ensure blush range includes deeper, saturated berry/plum and lavender that doesn’t gray out on deep skin.

## 6. Special insights

- Emerging Micro-Trends (early signals):
  - Blue highlighter normalization (Polar Ion; “skin of a killer” silvery icy highlights).
  - Greige/gray lip liners as universal contour shade; single-liner lip wardrobes.
  - Face decals/stamps (stars/hearts) as quick graphic add-ons for reels.
  - True holo revival in eyeshadows (not just nails) with strong wearer acceptance.

- Unexpected Pairings:
  - Lipstick-as-blush and liquid blush-as-lip (seen in look lists); opal/cool highlights on cupid’s bow for dimensional lips.
  - Skincare-mix base hacks (bean essence + foundation) and eyeshadow primer on nose to fix adhesion—merch opportunity for “base rescue” kits.
  - Orange lashes with green shimmer lids; black gloss with red glitter over gray-lined lips.

- Creative Insight:
  - “Frosted Goth” is the week’s fusion: soft, icy textures layered over grunge structures. Curate looks that marry black smokey structure (easy halo map, gray waterline, bleached brow aesthetic) with high-impact icicle toppers and lilac blush—plus a juicy stain. It bridges Valentine hearts and Soulsborne goth in a way customers are already responding to.
