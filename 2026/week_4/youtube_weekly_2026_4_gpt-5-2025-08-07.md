# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key takeaway: For the week of Jan 19–25, 2026, indie eyeshadow launches and cool-toned cheek/eye color dominated. Multiple creators rallied around three new palette stories (SINGE, Starborn, Gourmande Girls) and lavender/cool blush, with visible purchase triggers tied to launch timing, affiliate codes, and value narratives.

## 1. Overview

Creator energy was high and product-led: multi-look demos and swatch reels outpaced standard reviews. The tone skewed confident and instructive (how to layer, how to make brights wearable), with strong trust signals from creators known for indie coverage.

Texture talk was front-and-center. Shimmers were dissected (dry, dimensional vs wet, cushiony) and primer techniques (dedicated shimmer bases) were repeatedly shown to maximize shift and reduce creasing. Blush discourse emphasized satin/glowy-but-not-glitter finishes and buildable pigment.

A clear cool-toned resurgence emerged: purples, teals, and lavender/purple-toned blushes. In parallel, a Valentine “pink maximalism” thread ran through several videos—but often with a smoky/alt or grungy twist rather than “soft/fresh” takes.

Influencer skepticism targeted luxury mainstream (Chanel/Byredo swatch performance) and certain jelly/gel stick formats. Value and ethics narratives (cruelty-free alignment, transparent pricing, bundle discounts) elevated indie launches and K-beauty hybrids.

Nostalgia content (2016 looks, Twilight collab) resurfaced blue smokey eyes/matte lips in commentary, but the week’s actionable momentum stayed with indie color launches and wearable-cool cheeks.

  - Cool-toned blushes: lavender, cool mauves, deep plums in satin/glow (non-glitter) finishes; prioritize sheer-buildable formulas
  - Cool-toned palettes: purples/teals/greys with dry, dimensional sparkly shimmers; include depth and light anchors
  - Shimmer enhancers: glitter/shimmer adhesives/primers akin to Clionadh Shine-On
  - Colored liners/mascaras: olive, navy, plum, metallic reds; indie or K-beauty options with reliable wear
  - Lip systems: deep liners + high-shine gloss stains/lip oils (Persona- or Laneige-style hybrids); stock complementary pairings to enable “recipes”

- Caution / deprioritize
  - Jelly/high-shine stick highlighters and very dewy stick concealers for under-eye use; creators express skepticism
  - Luxury-branded, low-payoff eyeshadows; sentiment may suppress conversion even if stocked

- Gaps to fill
  - Lavender blush at multiple depths (fair to deep) with satin glow
  - Dry-texture sparkly shimmers in cool tones (lilac, teal, icy mint) plus a matching shimmer base
  - Affordable, reliable colored mascaras beyond black/brown
  - Peel-off/long-wear lip liners or indie stain alternatives that replicate the 24h practicality without mass-brand positioning
