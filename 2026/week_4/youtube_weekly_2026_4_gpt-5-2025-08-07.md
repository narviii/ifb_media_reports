# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key takeaway: For the week of Jan 19–25, 2026, indie color stories dominated creator content, with cross‑channel momentum around new creator-owned launches (Starborn Cosmetics, SINGE), Valentine’s-leaning pink palettes, and cool-toned/grungy aesthetics—driving clear purchase intent via visuals, codes, and launch timing.

## 1. Overview

- The week felt decisively indie-first and product-driven. Creators leaned into dramatic, high-shine eye looks with duochromes/multichromes, pairing them with goth/alt styling and deep lips.  
- Sentiment skewed strongly positive for indie palettes; skepticism showed up against luxury/larger brands (quality-to-price mismatch) and some mainstream innovations.  
- Value and trust narratives were explicit: creators emphasized formula performance on camera, disclosed affiliate ties, and in one case provided an ethics-forward “truthful” stance that strengthens downstream conversion.  
- Seasonal cues split between moody winter cool tones (rankings, teals/purples/greys) and Valentine’s maximalist pinks; both aesthetics were presented as high-impact rather than “soft” or minimalist.  
- Technique talk centered on layering: sticky bases for shimmers, black cream/stick bases to deepen and amplify, and liquid-to-powder blush stacks for longevity.  
- Customization gained airtime via singles/re-releases, reinforcing consumer appetite for curated shade building and toppers.

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

Top mentioned indie products with sentiment and context:
- Starborn Cosmetics Nascent (new brand by Bad to the Brow) – Positive
  - Cross-creator praise (battybean, Rachel, Heather, Angelica mention). Grungy olives/oranges with dry, twinkly shimmers; buildable mattes; not “squishy.” Early-hype, launch-week coverage with multiple looks.
- Gourmande Girls Bleeding Hearts – Positive
  - Multiple creators (battybean multi-posts, Rachel, Heather) cite strong pigmentation, unexpected range beyond berries, standout shimmers (Glass Heart), and success over black bases.
- Bella Beaute Bar x DeeAndra Pinky Promise – Positive
  - Repeated short- and long-form demos; “ultimate pink” with depth and specialty finishes. Packaging/theme resonate (Y2K/nostalgia; inclusivity callouts for deeper skin).
- SINGE Succulent Dew + Evocative Blush shade extension – Positive
  - Cool-toned, jewel/teal/purple palette; creators confirm blendability and impactful shimmers. Lavender/violet blush notes (“finally a lavender blush”) signal unmet demand now addressed.
- Nomad Cosmetics Paris La Bohème – Positive
  - High-impact shimmers and smooth mattes; used as a comparison point for shifty lids.
- Oden’s Eye Christmas singles – Positive/mixed detail
  - Loved color stories; shimmers loosely pressed (fallout risk) and missing some deep mattes in singles format; glitter primer recommended.

Other movers:
- Enablers: Clionadh x BadToTheBrow Shine-On (sticky shimmer base), DeDe Signature primers, Hard Candy black shadow marker for smoky bases—all positively referenced as payoff multipliers.
- Cheek: Blend Bunny Pro Blush Palette’s glowy shade used as highlighter drew explicit praise; SINGE and Rare Beauty blush layering got strong visual validation.
- Lips: Unearthly liners + Lawless gloss, Menagerie liquid lips, Black Moon liners/lips—positive synergy in “lip combo” content.

Note clusters:
- “Lots of creators testing Starborn and Gourmande Girls” with multi-look formats and launch date reminders.
- Duochrome/multichrome shimmers are the default center of looks; sticky bases and finger application are the taught methods.
- Repeat critique: luxury palettes (Chanel/Byredo) underwhelm relative to price; some mainstream shimmers (ColourPop older formulas, Oden’s loose press) need aids (glitter glue) for best results.

Common combos tested:
- Shimmer enhancer (Clionadh Shine-On) + indie shimmers (Starborn/Gourmande/Nomad).
- Black shadow stick/marker base + multichrome shimmer (amplifies depth/sparkle).
- Liquid blush (Rare Beauty) base + powder blush (SINGE) to set/intensify.
- Lip liner (Unearthly, MOB, Black Moon) + gloss (Lawless) to create custom stains/shine.

## 3. Category Trends

- Momentum categories: Eyeshadow palettes (indie, color-forward) led decisively; blush saw renewed attention via unconventional tones (lavender, purples) and layering; lip liners + gloss/stain hybrids trended for custom color/long-wear.
- Aesthetics/textures: Cool-toned moody palettes (greys, teals, purples) and grungy greens; Valentine’s pink maximalism; duochrome/multichrome sparkles; high-impact glow used as “blushlight.”
- Technique gravitation: Sticky/shimmer bases, deep cream/pen bases, colored liner/mascara accents, and deliberate monochrome or high-contrast pairings (green/orange, pink/purple).
- Seasonal shift: Winter cool-tone rankings met a Valentine’s surge in saturated pinks/reds; both read dramatic vs minimalist.

## 4. Emerging Themes & Narratives

- Creator-founded indie launches as trust engines:
  - Starborn (Milly) and SINGE (Angelica) received cross-creator validation for quality and pricing, with creators advocating directly for the founders.
- Shimmer science and accessorizing:
  - Across creators, shifty sparkle is prized; sticky enhancers (Clionadh Shine-On, DeDe primers) and black bases are normalized tools to unlock payoff.
- Cool-tone revival with grunge undertones:
  - Multiple videos rank/praise cool palettes; olive/teal/purple and smoky grey aesthetics span looks and launches.
- Valentine’s but alt:  
  - Pink-heavy palettes framed as “smoky meets Valentine’s,” often paired with goth/alt lips; not “soft glam.”
- Customization and singles:
  - Oden’s Eye singles re-release sparked talk on rebuilding custom palettes; singles + toppers are positioned as strategic add-ons.
- Regional signals:
  - K‑beauty integration gains visibility (Olive Young x Sephora news; Laneige lip oil stain interest). Western indie color brands maintain peak visibility and positive sentiment. Luxury Western brands face quality skepticism this week.

## 5. Purchase-Intent Signals

- High-intent clusters:
  - Launch-week urgency (Starborn Nascent; Gourmande Girls Bleeding Hearts; SINGE drops) + ubiquitous affiliate codes.
  - Repeated “excellent blendability” and “insane sparkle” claims with macro visuals.
  - “Finally a lavender blush” and purple blush layering demos indicate pent-up demand for unconventional cheek shades.
  - Bundle/value nudges (R.E.M. quads bundle; SINGE build-your-own blush bundles; Clionadh sale stacking) reinforce cart size growth.
  - Ethical/trust signaling (transparency video) likely increases conversion on the creator’s endorsed indie SKUs.
- Where interest softens:
  - Luxury quads/palettes criticized for payoff vs price; some mainstream “jelly” sticks and older shimmer formulas viewed as finicky or not worth it without aids.

## 6. Opportunities for the Store

Stocking priorities (move quickly):
- Eyeshadow palettes with momentum:
  - Starborn Cosmetics Nascent (early-hype, cross-creator validation).
  - Gourmande Girls Bleeding Hearts (Valentine’s timing; proven performance across creators).
  - SINGE Succulent Dew (cool-toned demand; brand credibility).
  - Bella Beaute Bar x DeeAndra Pinky Promise (pink maximalism; inclusive shade design).
  - Nomad Paris La Bohème (shifty shimmer benchmarks).
- Cheek:
  - Lavender/violet and cool-toned blushes (SINGE’s range; “Fearless Fig”). Curate “blush layering duos” (liquid + powder) to meet the technique trend.
- Eye enhancers/tools:
  - Sticky shimmer enhancers (e.g., Clionadh Shine-On equivalents if not available), high-adhesion glitter glues, and blendable black shadow sticks/pens for smoky bases.
- Liners/mascara accents:
  - Colored gel liners (green/teal/navy/burgundy) and colored mascaras that pair with grunge/cool-toned looks.
- Lips:
  - Deep, cool-toned liners (Unearthly, Black Moon) and high-shine gloss toppers; consider hybrid gloss-stain offerings to capture the “lip combo” custom-shade behavior.

Merchandising plays:
- Build a “Cool-Tone & Grunge” edit (teals, olives, purples, greys) with matching colored liners/mascaras.
- “Alt Valentine” capsule (Pinky Promise/Bleeding Hearts + deep liners/liquid lips + glowy blush-highlighters).
- Singles/Toppers bar: duochrome/iridescent singles plus required bases/adhesives; encourage BYO mini palettes.

Attach-rate tactics:
- Auto-bundle sticky base with any multichrome/topper purchase.
- Offer lip-liner + gloss pairing discounts; liquid-and-powder blush duos for durability.
- Prompt shade-depth add-ons (deep mattes/eyeliners) where palettes skew mid-tone or shimmer-heavy.

Risk/avoid or message carefully:
- Luxury palettes with negative payoff chatter (Chanel/Byredo) are poor value for this audience.
- Manage expectations on loosely pressed shimmers (recommend primer in-cart).
- Monitor mainstream “jelly” sticks; mixed sentiment suggests limited buy-in.
- Maintain CF/ethics alignment; avoid brands flagged for controversy or reliability issues.

Market gaps to fill:
- More cool-toned, muted palettes at mid price points (not just LE or collab).
- Lavender/purple cheek products in multiple depths/finishes.
- Long-wear lip stains/peel-off liners from indie or K‑beauty partners as hybrid lip demand rises.
- Colored mascara in wearable jewel tones aligned to grunge/cool palettes.

Overall: Lean into indie color, shifty textures, and alt-leaning seasonal storytelling. Pair every sparkle with a base; pair every bold cheek with a set-layer. This week’s creator content is primed to convert if you merchandise for technique as much as for shade.
