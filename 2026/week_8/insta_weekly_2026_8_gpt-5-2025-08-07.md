# Weekly Instagram Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key Takeaway (Feb 16–22, 2026): Cool-toned sparkle surged—icy blues, silvers, and green iridescents led the feed—on the back of indie launches (Glaminatrix The Old Soul, Terra Moons Lunar Amethyst, Nomad Cruise) and Half Magic’s new blue Glitter Puck; audiences leaned into tutorial-style reels, macro swatches, and “POV: shade roundups,” showing clear buy-now energy.

- The Vibe:
  - Launch-heavy week: multi-brand rollouts with dense swatch content and macro eye demos.
  - “POV: you’re looking for…” curation posts (green iridescents, pink chromes, blue sparkles) plus shade-by-shade education.
  - Short, actionable tutorials (blurred lips, moody grey/black lip layering, waterline tips), base wear tests (Maybelline), and companion palette swatches (all-shimmer next to all-matte).
- Engagement Temperature:
  - Hot. Frequent “need/add to cart,” availability questions, and region-release frustration (Laneige; Half Magic in AU).
  - High intent on blue sparkle, green iridescents, reflective silvers, and blurred-brown lip looks. Repeated asks about wear time/creasing, primers/adhesives, coverage, and exact shade names.

    - Macro eye swatch reels with 2–3 shade focus and texture notes; “POV: you need X color story” carousels.
    - Short wear tests (before/after) for sparkly toppers over different primers; split-eye creasing tests.
    - Lip combo shorts: blurred cool-brown base + grey/black haze + iridescent topper.
    - Drop alerts by region (solve Laneige/Half Magic availability confusion).
  - Use creator language:
    - “Neutrals-with-a-twist,” “wet-look shimmer,” “green-brown duochrome,” “iridescent (not white-base),” “flaky vs smooth.”
- Gap Analysis:
  - Ethics sensitivity: Some refuse Made By Mitchell—position alternative under-eye brightening powders (e.g., Hourglass Ambient Lighting, Huda Easy Bake Duo) and soft-focus presses.
  - Waterline durability: Stock high-adhesion kajals (Victoria Beckham Beauty, LA Girl Shockwave, UD 24/7) and advise set-with-powder trick.
  - Crease control: Push NYX Glitter Primer, Give Me Glow Glitter Base, Danessa ColorFix as anchors; educate on thin sunscreen layers and skincare absorption (echo Robert’s 5‑minute blot method).
  - Grey/mauve blush gap: Bring in cool-grey/mauve blushes (Half Magic Magic Brownie family, Rituel de Fille cool tones, Melt/AF cooler cheek options).

## 6. Special insights

- Emerging Micro-Trends:
  - Icy blue everything: from Half Magic’s Princess Ghost to Kaleidos blue sparkles and SBSD Blue Hues—blue sparkle is the season’s defining accent across eyes and lips.
  - Greyed lips + hazy black overlays: sheered black balms/liners over taupe/brown bases for “moody blur” without full opacity.
  - All‑shimmer “companion” palettes as standalone stars (Electrum’s shimmer‑only; Nomad’s dedicated shimmer deck), with shoppers mixing over cool matte scaffolds.
  - Green iridescents as face highlights: cross‑using eye toppers on cheekbones for ethereal glow.
- Unexpected Pairings:
  - Highlighter-as-lip (Dieverune Drop over liners); glitter pucks dusted as face highlight; blue gloss over brown/grey lips.
  - Partial overline technique (center‑heavy) for pout, leaving sides “honest” (Kulfi demo).
- Creative insight:
  - Build a “Sparkle Bar” in-store: organize toppers by undertone (icy blue, green iridescent, pink chrome, silver wet‑look) and by texture (smooth, sparkly, flaky). Provide a tacky-base testing station and side-by-side “matte base + topper” kits (e.g., Old Soul taupe + Princess Ghost; Nomad cool matte + Emerald Jewel shimmer).
  - Lean into lo‑fi nostalgia: feature “2MP camera” filters for swatch stories to mirror creator aesthetics and boost saves.
  - Offer “Neutral + Twist” bundles: cool matte quads + a single high-impact multichrome to meet the week’s most re‑created look archetype.
