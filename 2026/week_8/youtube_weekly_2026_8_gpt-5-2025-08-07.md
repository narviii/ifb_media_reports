# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key takeaway: Feb 16–22, 2026 was dominated by cool-toned, grunge-glam eyes and high-shine textures, with Nomad’s Cruise Collection and Glaminatrix Old Soul commanding attention while pre-launch buzz built around Adept’s Sapphire Selene (Feb 26).

## 1. Overview

Creators leaned hard into moody, cool palettes (blues, greys, purples) and “wet-look” sparkle. Tutorials prioritized texture management (glitter glue, tacky primers) and matte–shimmer layering to maximize payoff with minimal fallout.

Enthusiasm skewed indie-first: Nomad’s new matte/shimmer companion concept and magnetic pans were hailed as user-centric innovations; Glaminatrix earned “so pretty” swatch-driven hype with a caveat that the color story feels familiar. Adept’s Sapphire Selene drew early demand on formula novelty (chameleon sparkle) and more mattes than usual.

Alt/goth nostalgia surged via ColourPop x Twilight “Eclipse,” which creators celebrated for smokey greys and vampy reds—often benchmarking Blend Bunny’s matte quality as the performance gold standard. High-impact duochrome highlighters (pinky/iridescent) and blush layering/draping were recurring finish choices across looks.

The week balanced excitement with pragmatic technique talk: repeated reminders to use glitter glue/primer, manage crumblier shimmers, and expect mess with flakier pans. Value and usability framed purchasing decisions more than brand hype alone.

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

- Top mentioned indie products
  - Nomad Cosmetics Cruise Collection
    - Coastal Cruise (all-matte): strong consensus on dense, easy-to-blend mattes; praised as among Nomad’s best mattes; magnetic, removable pans noted as a major plus.
    - Aurora/Crystal Cruise (all-shimmer): standout reflectivity/multichrome shifts; consistent notes on soft/crumblier press and fallout; glitter/tacky primer strongly recommended.
    - Sunrise/Sunset Cruise Highlighters: repeatedly called “wet,” “blingy,” and smooth; pink-lavender shift high demand driver.
  - Glaminatrix The Old Soul: high shimmer intensity and smooth mattes; requires glitter glue for sparkliest textures; color story “familiar but excellent” (quality-over-novelty appeal).
  - Adept Sapphire Selene (pre-launch): new “chameleon sparkle powder” formula and expanded mattes; compared favorably against Adept’s own lineup (non-duplicative); packaging reliability credibility callout.
  - Blend Bunny Diabla: artist-focused 28-shade depth; mattes/shimmers praised; brand repeatedly used as performance benchmark; Pro Blush Palette continues to be an indie staple in combos.
  - Oden’s Eye Ice Crystal: cool-toned, blue-silver sparkle executed cleanly; strong short-form tutorial pull.
  - Wicked Widow Rocky Horror Show: improved shimmers vs prior; price sensitivity tied to IP licensing noted.
  - Bella Beauté Bar: Cosmic Dust Sparkle Balm and Dead Roses highlighter/sparkle products showed up in multiple lip/cheek looks; sparkle balm over dark liner trend is sticky.
  - Gourmande Girls Bleeding Hearts: seasonal Valentine’s tie-in; seen as versatile (grunge vs bright).

- Sentiment trends
  - Positive cluster: Nomad mattes; Nomad highlighters; Glaminatrix Old Soul quality; Adept Sapphire Selene uniqueness; Blend Bunny Diabla/Pro Blush; Oden’s Eye Ice Crystal.
  - Mixed/qualified: Nomad shimmers (great payoff but crumbly; fallout); Glaminatrix Lip & Cheek Flushes (nice on cheeks, drying on lips); Melt Ultra Pinks (one dry matte).
  - Negative: Glossier Stretch Foundation (too dry; texture emphasis).

- Context and repeat notes
  - Performance: High-sparkle textures consistently require glitter glue/tacky primers (NYX Glitter Glue, About-Face Shadow Fix, Nomad Intense Primer, DeDe Sand Seal); matte-to-shimmer build is the working norm.
  - Shade/texture: Cool-toned revival (blues, greys, silvers), vampy reds; multichrome/duochrome shimmer topcoats; pink-lavender iridescent highlights.
  - Price/value: Magnetic pans (Nomad) framed as value via customization; IP collabs flagged for steeper price; Adept’s comparison segment reassured non-duplication.
  - Hype cycle: Nomad Cruise dominated active usage; Old Soul surged with launch-week content; Adept building pre-drop demand; ColourPop Twilight fueled nostalgia purchase intent among alt/goth fans.

- Product combos observed
  - Matte–shimmer pairing: Nomad Coastal (matte base) + Aurora/Crystal (shimmer topper).
  - Blush “sandwiching”: Rare Beauty Encourage liquid + Blend Bunny Pro Blush powder for longevity/dimension.
  - Lips: Black Moon Tortie (dark liner) + Bella Beauté Bar Cosmic Dust Sparkle Balm topper.
  - Cross-palette artistry: Fantasy Cosmetica Witch’s Familiar + Bard (curated contrasts); deep liners with shimmer-lid gradients common.

  - Tools/primers: glitter glues and tacky eye primers are now essential basket add-ons; small detail brushes featured.

- Aesthetics/textures
  - Grunge-glam, Twilight/goth nostalgia, nautical noir; metallic silvers and charcoal smokey eyes.

  - Familiar neutral-leaning color stories flagged as “not groundbreaking” even when formulas impress.
  - IP-collab pricing scrutiny.

- Seasonal shift

- Adjacent care
  - Glitter removal prep: Carry effective micellar waters and balmy cleansers; position them next to high-shimmer SKUs (Blend Bunny micellar, cleansing balms).
  - Seasonality: Keep a small Barbiecore/monochrome pink edit live, but shift homepage to cool-toned cruise/grunge looks for the next 2–4 weeks.

Overall: Lean into cool-toned grunge, high-shine textures, and customization. Bundle technique enablers (glue/primer/brushes) with sparkle-heavy items. Build kits that mirror creator-tested combos to capture immediate purchase intent.
