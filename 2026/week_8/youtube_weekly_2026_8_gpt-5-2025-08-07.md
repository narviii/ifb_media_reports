# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key takeaway: For the week of Feb 16–22, 2026, indie palettes dominated creator attention, with Nomad Cruise, Glaminatrix Old Soul, and Blend Bunny Diabla driving the conversation while dewy complexions and lip-care hybrids reinforced a soft-glow base trend ahead of spring launches.

## 1. Overview

Indie eyeshadow releases set the week’s tone. Multiple creators posted full looks, swatches, and launch reminders around Nomad’s Cruise Collection (two palettes + two highlighters), Glaminatrix’s Old Soul, and Blend Bunny’s Diabla—clear momentum and high test volume versus single-mention buzz.

Texture talk centered on multichromes/duochromes and how to make them pop (glitter glue/shimmer primers). “Grungy glam” persisted from Valentine pinks into murky greens/reds, while a fresh shift to coastal blues/teals and pinky glow highlighters signaled spring.

Complexion leaned dewy and minimal: creators spotlighted concealer-as-base and multi-shade concealer use (brighten + contour), with multiple looks created sans foundation. Lip content skewed glossy/oily/balm-forward with liner pairings.

Skepticism toward overlaunching resurfaced via “resist”/declutter content and a “slow beauty” stance. That said, excitement was selective: indie formulas praised for payoff, color stories, and value. One cautionary note on brand reliability (Shroud comms) tempered enthusiasm for nostalgic collabs.

Drugstore collabs (e.g., NYX x Bridgerton) drew mainstream clicks, but the independent space held narrative control on performance-led, color-forward artistry.
