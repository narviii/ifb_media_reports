# Weekly Instagram Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key Takeaway (Jan 12–18, 2026): Monochrome pink and icy-blue chrome looks dominated the week, anchored by Bella Beauté Bar’s Pinky Promise launch and Wet n Wild’s new chameleon chromes; audiences showed strong “add to cart” energy for affordable sparkles and creator-led collabs, while nostalgia-fueled 2016 glam surged in reach.

## 1. Overview

  - Launch-heavy week with creator collabs (BBB x Dee “Pinky Promise”) and indie debuts (Starborn “Nascent”), plus drugstore chrome expansions (Wet n Wild).

  - A parallel nostalgia stream: 2016 glam revival (matte base, sharp wings, bold vamp lips), served with high-energy GRWMs.

- Engagement Temperature:
  - Hot. Frequent “Link,” “Send me this post,” “I am buying,” region-availability questions, and restock asks.
  - Swatch carousels and first-impression reels drew purchase questions; creator-led narratives (Dee’s Reddit response; Lindsey’s UD critique/2016 series) went viral and shaped sentiment.

## 5. Opportunities for the Store

- Stocking Recommendations:
  - Monochrome pink and purple palettes with depth + high-impact shimmers (BBB Pinky Promise/adjacent SKUs); consider securing inventory with clear “not limited” messaging for delayed buyers.
  - Affordable iridescent/chrome singles/sticks in icy blue/green and pink (position against Wet n Wild buzz with indie-quality alternatives and ensure regional availability).
  - Cool-toned lip system:
    - Greige/taupe liners (OG Brew analogs), soft-matte browns, glassy toppers with iridescent flakes.
    - Grey/mint lip tints/glosses (rom&nd/K-beauty style) and duochrome metallic lip bullets.
  - Blue/mint/opal highlighters and multi-use glow sticks (Kosas/r.e.m. comps).
  - Anti-Valentine gothic romantic: deep shimmers, holo topcoats, blackened bases (preload for Gourmande Girls launch window).

- Content Strategy:
  - Short reels with:
    - Shade roll-calls and arm-to-eye transitions (GlamSmitty format) including “soft swipe vs built” for sparkles.
    - Side-by-side undertone comparisons (NYX OG vs reformulated) to drive liner sales.
    - “One single shadow transformation” (ColourPop/Ballerina style) and “face highlight from an eyeshadow” hacks (orange/blue).
  - Nostalgia tie-ins:
    - 2016 Glam kit challenges (matte base, wing, vamp lip) to tap viral momentum from Lindsey’s series.
  - Region-ready CTAs:
    - Pin retailer/availability answers, link-in-bio clarity, and “ships from US warehouse” notes (as Lethal did).

- Gap Analysis:
  - Brand sameness fatigue surfaced (Double Cleanse podcast): differentiate with creator-curated edits and flexible posting cadence (avoid mass same-day briefs).
  - Demand for louder liners/palettes vs big-brand safe launches (Urban Decay frustration): stock chartreuse/bubblegum/neon mattes and precision liners.
  - Support FAQs: hooded/oily lid wear for emollient shimmers; eye-safety labels; stain behavior of tints; explicit “LE vs core” badges; proactive restock timelines.

## 6. Special insights

- Emerging Micro-Trends:
  - Grey/mint “ghoul” lip tints crossing into mainstream (rom&nd; Kaleidos mentions).
  - Blue highlighters and non-traditional highlight hues (mint/opal/orange) used beyond eyes—“wearable weird” glow.
  - Metallic/duochrome lips resurging (Unearthly Menacing Metals; teal-topped bronze).

- Unexpected Pairings:
  - Eyeshadows as face highlighters (Starborn Genesis orange, Glisten blues).
  - Powder Kiss on eyes/lips/cheeks for full monochrome; lip toppers built from eyeshadow pans.
  - Chunky pink glitters “sandwiched” between holo and matte layers for high-depth lids.

- Creative insight:
  - Package Valentine/Anti-Valentine duos:
    - “Full Sparkle Menace” (pink holo + blush drape + berry glass) vs “Bleeding Hearts” (blackened shimmers + cyan/silver toppers).
  - Launch support with multi-skin-tone capture of shifts (Dee’s point on shifts reading differently); build UGC pipelines to showcase shifts across tones.
  - Lean into blue seasonality: “Winter Blues” edit (icy lids, royal blue liners, blue mascara, cool brown lips) as a turnkey kit.
