# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

- Key takeaway for the week of September 29–October 5, 2025: Indie eyeshadow palettes dominated discussions with a surge in spooky, gothic, and 70s-inspired themes, driving positive sentiment around creative color stories and high-quality formulas, while mainstream releases like Makeup By Mario drew neutral comparisons for lacking novelty.

## 1. Overview

The week showed strong excitement around indie brand launches, particularly those tied to seasonal spooky themes and alternative aesthetics, with creators frequently highlighting the quality and thematic depth of palettes from brands like Fantasy Cosmetica, Singe Beauty, and Lethal Cosmetics. This contrasted with some fatigue toward repetitive neutral palettes from luxury brands, where skepticism emerged over perceived similarities to prior releases.

Blush discussions centered on layering techniques for intensity and longevity, often combining cream and powder formulas, reflecting a broader interest in high-impact, sculpted looks. Lip products gained traction through new liner bundles and comfortable matte formulas, with creators noting gaps in cool-toned neutrals that indie brands are filling effectively.

Industry news included sadness over Flower Beauty's closure, underscoring volatility in mass-market brands, while positive signals like Sigma Beauty's Ulta expansion and Lethal Cosmetics' US warehouse improved accessibility. Overall, the landscape leaned toward value-driven indie innovation, with affiliate transparency and discount codes reinforcing creator-audience trust.

Influencer skepticism appeared in evaluations of novelty, such as Makeup By Mario's Nature palette being seen as too similar to existing options, prompting dupe comparisons. Texture talk focused on non-chunky shimmers and multichromes, with creators appreciating formulas that perform well on textured lids without fallout.

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

Top mentioned indie products included Fantasy Cosmetica's Witch's Familiar palette (praised across multiple creators for its gothic color story and pigmentation), Singe Beauty's Paisley Hoot palette (noted for 70s neutrals with multichrome twists and reliable formulas), and Lethal Cosmetics' Conjuring palette (highlighted for moody cool tones and blendable mattes). Other clusters featured Gourmande Girls Nevermore (grungy purples) and Blend Bunny x Mei Pang Rotten (grungy mattes with compact sizing).

Sentiment trends were predominantly positive for indie palettes' performance, shade innovation, and value, with mixed notes on specific items like Lethal's Sanctified Seal powder (sticky texture but effective crease prevention) and Makeup By Mario's Nature palette (beautiful but unoriginal). Negative sentiment was limited, mainly around Flower Beauty's closure (sadness over lost affordable quality).

Context centered on longevity, texture (non-chunky shimmers, buildable mattes), and price/value, with hype cycles positioning these as must-haves for spooky season. Lots of creators tested indie collabs like Witch's Familiar, making it a default for gothic looks, while repeat criticism focused on mainstream neutrals lacking differentiation.

## 3. Category Trends

Eyeshadow palettes showed the strongest momentum, with a shift toward moody, cool-toned stories featuring multichromes and saturated mattes (e.g., teals, purples, olives). Blush gained visibility through layering combos (cream bases topped with powders for saturation), gravitating toward lifted, sculpted placements and dramatic rosy hues.

Aesthetics leaned into gothic/witchy and grungy 70s vibes, with textures favoring non-emollient shimmers and creamy yet transfer-proof lip liners. Some fatigue emerged around repetitive neutral palettes, with creators passing on purchases due to inventory overload.

Seasonal shifts signaled rising demand for Halloween-themed items (witchy palettes, dark lipsticks) and autumnal warm neutrals, alongside early holiday bundles like Unearthly's cool-toned mysteries.

## 4. Emerging Themes & Narratives

- Indie brand dominance in spooky and alternative aesthetics appeared across creators like battybean, Rachel Palmieri, and Angelica Nyqvist, with high sentiment for creative collabs (e.g., Witch's Familiar, Conjuring) and momentum for Western indie origins like Singe Beauty and Fantasy Cosmetica, showing increased visibility and adoption.

- Neutral palettes with twists (e.g., 70s grunge, olive pops) were a cross-creator pattern in Rachel Palmieri and Heather Austin content, reflecting fatigue with basic neutrals and rising demand for versatile, non-traditional options.

- Accessibility improvements, such as Sigma's Ulta launch and Lethal's US warehouse, surfaced in multiple videos, indicating positive shifts in indie brand distribution and sentiment toward easier purchasing.

- Multichrome and shifting finishes gained traction in Heather Austin and battybean videos, with consistent praise for non-chunky textures and high reflectivity, pointing to sustained momentum for specialty effects in indie products.

## 5. Purchase-Intent Signals

High praise for indie palette quality and unique color stories (e.g., "obsessed" with Singe Beauty, "phenomenal" for Fantasy Cosmetica) triggered strong "I'd buy this" sentiment, especially for limited-edition collabs like Witch's Familiar. Repeat enthusiasm centered on formulas solving pain points, such as non-creasing shimmers for textured lids and cool-toned lip liners filling market gaps.

Value-driven comparisons, like Beauty Bay's affordability and affiliate discounts, implied rising purchase intent for accessible indies. Early hype built around unreleased items (e.g., Dede’Signature From The Roots) and restocks (Singe Beauty Galactic Visitor), with FOMO from mystery bundles and seasonal themes driving sales potential.

For an indie e-commerce store, signals suggest stocking thematic palettes and layering-friendly blushes could capitalize on demonstrated demand, as creators' emotional connections and visual proofs (swatches, looks) encourage replication.

## 6. Opportunities for the Store

Stock rising indie palettes like Fantasy Cosmetica Witch's Familiar and Singe Beauty Paisley Hoot, where demand is high due to spooky themes and positive formula feedback. Consider blush layering duos (e.g., cream-powder combos) and cool-toned lip liners, as these categories show momentum with gaps in unique neutrals.

Rising demand appears in multichrome highlighters (e.g., Lethal Music Box) and seasonal bundles, offering bundling opportunities. Reviews are consistently negative on sheer black lipsticks (e.g., Lethal Valak's Vengeance) and chunky shimmers, suggesting avoidance or alternatives.

Market gaps include affordable, non-repetitive neutrals and waterproof lip liners in underrepresented shades, as highlighted by creators—stock these to address creator-noted frustrations and capture intent from dupe-seeking audiences.
