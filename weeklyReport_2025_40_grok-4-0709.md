# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

- This week's content centered on indie eyeshadow palette launches with dark, seasonal themes, alongside brand news like closures and retail expansions, indicating strong momentum for alternative aesthetics in the October 1-7 period.

## 1. Overview

Creators showed consistent excitement for indie collaborations and spooky-themed palettes, with multiple videos highlighting witchy, grungy, and gothic color stories that align with Halloween demand. This enthusiasm contrasted with mild skepticism toward repetitive neutral palettes from mainstream brands, where originality was questioned despite solid formulas.

Brand stability emerged as a narrative, with the closure of Flower Beauty eliciting surprise and sadness over lost affordable quality, while positive developments like Sigma Beauty's Ulta launch and Lethal Cosmetics' US warehouse were celebrated for improving accessibility. Indie brands dominated discussions, often praised for high pigmentation and unique textures, though some products faced mixed feedback on functionality versus aesthetics.

Palette fatigue appeared in passing, with creators passing on purchases due to inventory overload, yet this was offset by value-driven comparisons emphasizing affordability and performance. Overall, the week felt like a buildup to seasonal shifts, with creators leaning into bold, thematic makeup while addressing practical consumer concerns like shipping and shade inclusivity.

Influencer transparency was evident through frequent affiliate code mentions and PR disclosures, fostering trust. Discussions also touched on personal creator milestones, such as collaborations attributed to audience support, reinforcing community-driven content.

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

Top mentioned indie products included Fantasy Cosmetica's Witch's Familiar palette (positive sentiment for pigmentation, versatility in gothic looks, and thematic packaging; seen as a standout collab across multiple creators), Singe Beauty's Paisley Hoot palette (positive for neutral-with-twist shades, opaque mattes, and non-creasing shimmers), Lethal Cosmetics' Conjuring palette (positive for moody color story and blendable formulas, though mixed on chunky shimmers), Blend Bunny's Rotten palette (positive for grungy mattes and compact size), and Bella Beaute Bar's Dark Dreamscape palette (positive for versatile purples/blues and multichrome finishes).

Sentiment trends leaned positive for indie eyeshadows, with consistent praise for high pigmentation, blendability, and novelty in textures like multichromes; mixed sentiments arose around originality (e.g., Makeup By Mario Nature palette seen as similar to prior releases) and functionality (e.g., Lethal's Sanctified Seal powder criticized for initial pilling but praised for crease prevention). Context clustered around performance in dramatic looks, with repeat criticism on sheer black lipsticks (e.g., Lethal Valak's Vengeance) and hype for affordable options like Beauty Bay Dark Lights.

Clusters showed lots of creators testing spooky indie palettes, positioning them as default for alternative aesthetics, while Flower Beauty's closure highlighted volatility in drugstore segments.

## 3. Category Trends

Eyeshadow palettes dominated momentum, with a clear gravitation toward dark, saturated mattes and multichrome shimmers in grungy or witchy aesthetics; no fatigue noted here, but subtle skepticism emerged for neutral iterations lacking novelty.

Blush showed rising interest through layering techniques (cream + powder combos for intensity and longevity), with aesthetics favoring lifted, high-pigment placements in rosy mauves; some fatigue around repetitive cream formulas, but value in indie options like Oden's Eye and Blend Bunny.

Lip products gained traction via liners and combos, emphasizing waterproof, transfer-proof formulas in unique neutrals (e.g., cool taupes); highlighters trended toward shifting, non-base multichromes for otherworldly effects.

Seasonal shifts signaled demand for cool-toned, moody palettes transitioning into winter, with early holiday bundles (e.g., Unearthly) implying preparatory buying.

## 4. Emerging Themes & Narratives

- Indie brand dominance and collaborations: Multiple creators emphasized excitement for creator-led indie launches (e.g., Battybean x Fantasy Cosmetica, Blend Bunny x Mei Pang), noting high quality and audience-driven development; this aligned across videos, with positive sentiment for Western indie momentum over mainstream.
- Spooky/witchy aesthetics: Cross-creator focus on gothic, Halloween-themed color stories (purples, teals, deep reds) in palettes like Witch's Familiar and Conjuring, gaining visibility and adoption for alternative looks; sentiment was highly positive, with rising momentum for these non-traditional themes.
- Multichrome and shimmer preferences: Repeated praise for shifting textures in eyeshadows and highlighters (e.g., Bella Beaute Bar, Lethal Music Box), with patterns of using them as toppers or for dimension; this showed consistent creator adoption, though some noted fatigue with chunky formulas.
- Brand accessibility and stability: Discussions of retail expansions (Sigma at Ulta, Lethal US warehouse) improved purchase ease, contrasting with concerns over closures like Flower Beauty; positive sentiment for indie growth, with regional signals favoring Western brands over K/J/C-beauty this week.

## 5. Purchase-Intent Signals

High "I'd buy this" sentiment clustered around indie palettes with thematic appeal (e.g., Witch's Familiar, Paisley Hoot), driven by FOMO for limited collabs and bundles; repeat enthusiasm for versatile formulas like Singe's non-creasing shimmers implied strong demand.

Value statements favored affordable indies (e.g., Beauty Bay at $21) and accessibility boosts (Sigma at Ulta for rewards), with affiliate codes frequently offered as direct incentives.

Early hype formed around unreleased items like Dede’Signature From The Roots and niche products like Singe's unique lip liners, signaling purchase intent for gap-filling shades.

Patterns in layered blush demos and multichrome highlighters suggested rising sales potential for products enabling dramatic, long-wear looks.

## 6. Opportunities for the Store

Consider stocking indie eyeshadow palettes with spooky/gothic themes (e.g., Fantasy Cosmetica, Lethal Conjuring) where demand is rising due to seasonal alignment and positive pigmentation feedback.

Rising interest in lip liners (unique neutrals like Singe's cool taupes) and multichrome highlighters (e.g., Bella Beaute Bar) points to gaps in affordable, shifting formulas; prioritize these for alternative aesthetic buyers.

Reviews were consistently negative on sheer black lipsticks and chunky shimmers, suggesting avoidance or alternatives; instead, focus on blendable mattes and waterproof liners to capitalize on value-driven intent.

Bundle options for blush layering (cream + powder) and holiday mystery sets could drive sales, addressing clusters of versatility and FOMO signals.
