# Weekly YouTube Beauty Media Landscape Report

The week of September 29 to October 5, 2025, saw a surge in indie palette launches timed for Halloween, with creators emphasizing moody, thematic color stories amid broader discussions of brand closures and retail expansions.

## 1. Overview

Creators leaned into seasonal excitement with multiple indie palette reviews, highlighting grungy and witchy aesthetics that align with autumn demand. Palette fatigue appeared in some discussions, where affordability and inventory overload prompted selective buying, yet high-quality formulas from brands like Singe Beauty and Fantasy Cosmetica sustained enthusiasm.

Industry news included the closure of Flower Beauty, sparking reflections on drugstore volatility, contrasted by Sigma Beauty's Ulta expansion for better accessibility. Skepticism emerged around repetitive neutral palettes from luxury brands like Makeup by Mario, with creators favoring indie innovation in multichromes and shimmers.

Blush and lip categories showed momentum through layering techniques and unique neutrals, while highlighters with shifting finishes gained traction. Overall, the week reflected a shift toward indie-driven creativity, with cross-creator alignment on value comparisons and formula performance.

## 2. Product Momentum (What’s Being Talked About)

Top mentioned indie products centered on eyeshadow palettes, including Fantasy Cosmetica's Witch's Familiar (positive sentiment for pigmentation, versatility in gothic looks across battybean and Rachel Palmieri videos), Singe Beauty's Paisley Hoot (positive for neutral-with-twist shades, blendability, and textured-lid performance in Angelica Nyqvist and Rachel Palmieri content), and Lethal Cosmetics' Conjuring palette (positive for moody colors and mattes, mixed on chunky shimmers per Rachel Palmieri and battybean).

Gourmande Girls' Nevermore drew positive sentiment for its grungy purple-green story and value (Rachel Palmieri, Angelica Nyqvist). Bella Beaute Bar's Dark Dreamscape palette and highlighter received positive feedback for multichrome shifts and versatility (Heather Austin, Angelica Nyqvist, battybean). Makeup by Mario's Ethereal Eyes Nature had neutral sentiment, seen as repetitive neutrals with good mattes but lacking novelty (Rachel Palmieri, Heather Austin, Angelica Nyqvist).

Clusters included repeated praise for indie formulas' high quality and thematic depth, with criticism around sheer lip finishes (Lethal black lipstick) and unusual textures (Lethal setting powder). Blush products like Rare Beauty's Believe/Chamoy showed positive longevity in layered combos (battybean).

## 3. Category Trends

Eyeshadow palettes dominated with strong momentum, focusing on grungy, spooky, and nature-inspired aesthetics like witchy teals/purples (Fantasy Cosmetica, Lethal Conjuring) and earthy neutrals (Singe Paisley Hoot, Nomad Pacific Northwest). Creators gravitated toward multichrome shimmers and deep mattes for dimension, with no fatigue noted in this category despite general palette overload.

Blush gained traction through layering cream and powder for intensity and lift (battybean's combos with Lawless, Oden's Eye, Rare Beauty), emphasizing high-pigment, sculpted placement. Lip products shifted to unique neutrals and liners (Singe Evocative, Melt Cosmetics), with positive sentiment for waterproof, creamy formulas filling market gaps.

Highlighters showed emerging interest in shifting finishes (Lethal Music Box, Bella Beaute Bar Dark Dreamscape), favoring smooth, non-chunky textures. Seasonal shifts signaled rising demand for cool-toned, moody products ahead of Halloween, with some skepticism on repetitive neutrals.

## 4. Emerging Themes & Narratives

- Indie Brand Dominance and Collaborations: Multiple creators (Rachel Palmieri, battybean, Angelica Nyqvist, Heather Austin) highlighted indie launches from Fantasy Cosmetica, Singe Beauty, and Bella Beaute Bar, noting rising momentum through high-quality formulas and creator collabs, with positive sentiment for accessibility via affiliate codes and US warehousing (Lethal Cosmetics).

- Spooky/Seasonal Aesthetics: Cross-creator alignment (battybean, Rachel Palmieri, Angelica Nyqvist) on witchy, grungy themes in palettes like Witch's Familiar and Conjuring, showing increased visibility and adoption for Halloween-timed releases.

- Brand Volatility and Accessibility: Discussions of Flower Beauty's closure (Rachel Palmieri, Angelica Nyqvist) contrasted with Sigma's Ulta expansion, signaling concerns over mass-market stability while praising retail moves for reward-point usage.

- Formula Innovation in Shimmers/Multichromes: At least two creators (Heather Austin, Rachel Palmieri) noted preference for non-chunky, shifting textures in highlighters and shadows, with Western indie brands gaining momentum over repetitive luxury neutrals.

## 5. Purchase-Intent Signals

High praise for indie palette quality and thematic uniqueness (Fantasy Cosmetica Witch's Familiar, Singe Paisley Hoot) triggered "I'd buy this" sentiment, with creators like battybean and Angelica Nyqvist expressing obsession and repeat wear. Affiliate codes across videos (e.g., BATTYBEAN, RACHEL) created direct incentives, amplified by scarcity signals like limited stock and restocks (Unearthly Bundles, Singe Galactic Visitor).

Value-driven comparisons, such as Beauty Bay's affordability and Sigma's Ulta accessibility, implied rising demand for accessible indies. Early hype built around unreleased items (Dede’Signature From The Roots) and unique formulas (Lethal highlighter shifts) suggested purchase intent for novelty. Layered blush demos (battybean) and versatile lip liners (Singe Evocative) showed enthusiasm for performance, potentially driving sales in these categories.

## 6. Opportunities for the Store

Consider stocking indie eyeshadow palettes with spooky themes (Fantasy Cosmetica Witch's Familiar, Lethal Conjuring) where demand is rising due to consistent positive sentiment on pigmentation and versatility. Unique lip liners like Singe Evocative fill gaps in cool-toned neutrals, with strong purchase signals from creator endorsements.

Shifting highlighters (Bella Beaute Bar Dark Dreamscape, Lethal Music Box) present opportunities amid positive feedback, while avoiding repetitive neutrals like Makeup by Mario Nature, which drew mixed reviews for lack of originality. Blush layering products (Rare Beauty liquids, Oden's Eye powders) could drive sales in combos, and monitor brand closures like Flower Beauty for clearance stock to address value-seeking consumers.
